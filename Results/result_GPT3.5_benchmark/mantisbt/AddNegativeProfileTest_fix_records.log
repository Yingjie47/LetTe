Test Intent: 

The test case AddNegativeProfileTest.java is testing the functionality of adding a negative profile in a web application. The test case first sets up the environment by logging in as an administrator. Then, it navigates to the account profile menu and attempts to add a profile with missing information (specifically the "Platform" field is left empty intentionally). 

The test case intends to verify that when a necessary field like "Platform" is left empty, the system correctly displays an error message indicating the missing field. This test case aims to validate the behavior of the application in handling negative scenarios when incomplete data is submitted for profile creation.

2024-10-29 17:49:37,106:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Issue #" element present in the old version is missing in the new version. This element has been replaced by multiple new elements such as "new", "feedback", "acknowledged", "confirmed", "assigned", "resolved", and "closed" in the new version.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is most likely the removal of the "Issue #" element in the new version. The error message indicates that the test case is unable to locate an element with the XPath "//a[@href='account_page.php']", which is not included in the provided major elements of either version. This suggests that the test case might be trying to interact with an element that was not specified in the provided major elements.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in XPath: The XPath for all major elements have changed in the new version, which can cause the test case to fail if it is hardcoded with the old XPaths.
2. Additional Elements: The new version includes additional elements such as "new", "feedback", "acknowledged", "confirmed", "assigned", "resolved", and "closed". If the test case is not updated to handle these new elements, it may fail.
3. Missing Element Handling: If the test case was expecting the "Issue #" element and did not have proper handling for its absence in the new version, it could lead to failure.
4. Potential Code Changes: The error message indicates a NoSuchElementException, which suggests that the test case is unable to locate an element. This could also be caused by changes in the application code affecting element visibility or availability.

To resolve the test case failure, the test case needs to be updated to accommodate the changes in the application elements between the old and new versions. This includes updating XPaths, handling new elements, and modifying test logic to address any missing elements.

2024-10-29 17:51:09,476:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old version with the new version, we can see that the "Issue #" element with xpath "//*[@id="main_div"]/div[4]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/form/input[1]" from the old version is missing in the new version. This missing element is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

The error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[@href='account_page.php']"}" indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with the xpath "//a[@href='account_page.php']", but it is not present on the page. This element was not part of the major elements listed for either the old or the new version, so it seems to be an additional element being accessed in the test case code that is not part of the main elements being compared.

The test case is failing because it is expecting an element that is not present in either the old or the new version of the web application. This could be due to a new feature or functionality added to the web application that the test case is not accounting for. It is important to update the test case to reflect any changes in the application and ensure that it is testing the correct elements.

In summary, the root cause of the test case failure is likely the missing "Issue #" element in the new version, and the additional element "//a[@href='account_page.php']" being accessed in the test case code which is not part of the main elements being compared.

Test Intent: The test case AddNegativeProfileTest.java is testing the scenario of adding a new profile with a necessary field ("Platform") left empty. The test aims to verify that the system correctly detects the missing required field and provides the appropriate error message to the user.

The test case sets up by logging in as an administrator and navigating to the page where a new profile can be added. It then attempts to add a profile with the "Platform" field left empty and submits the form. After submission, the test case verifies that the error message displayed on the page matches the expected error message for a missing "Platform" field.

Overall, the test intends to ensure that the system correctly handles and prompts users when attempting to add a profile with essential information missing, specifically focusing on the "Platform" field.

2024-10-29 17:57:33,615:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the xpath for "Password," "Confirm Password," "E-mail," and "Real Name" elements have changed in the new version. However, the xpath for the "Update User" element remains the same.

The error message indicates that the test case failed due to the inability to locate an element with the xpath "//a[@href='account_prof_menu_page.php']". Since this element is not listed in the provided main elements for both the old and new versions, we can assume that it might be a new element introduced in the updated version that the test case is now trying to interact with.

Given that the first element removed is likely the root cause of the test case failure, it is possible that the "Password" element was removed in the new version. This change in the structure of the page, specifically the removal of the "Password" element, has caused the test case to fail when trying to locate and interact with it.

To address this issue, the test case needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the element locators in the new version. Specifically, the xpath for the "Password" element needs to be updated to match the new xpath ("/html/body/div[2]/form/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/input"). By updating the test case with the correct xpath for the "Password" element, the test case should be able to locate and interact with the element successfully, resolving the failure.
