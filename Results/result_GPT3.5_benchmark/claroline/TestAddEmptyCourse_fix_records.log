**Test Case Intent:**

The test case `TestAddEmptyCourse.java` is designed to test the functionality of adding a new course on a web application. The main intent of this test case is to validate the behavior of the system when attempting to add a course without providing a course title and course code.

1. **Setup:**
   - The `@BeforeMethod` annotated method sets up the test environment by configuring the WebDriver to use the Chrome driver, setting implicit wait time, and navigating to the base URL of the application.

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Enter the admin username and password into the respective input fields.
   - Click on the login button to authenticate as an admin user.
   - Click on the "Create a course site" link to initiate the course creation process.
   - Click on the button to change course properties without providing a course title and course code.

3. **Assertions:**
   - The test case then verifies that the system correctly displays error messages indicating that a course title and course code are needed for creating a course.
   - The first assertion checks if the error message for the course title requirement is displayed on the page.
   - The second assertion checks if the error message for the course code requirement is displayed on the page.

4. **Test Case Operation Intent:**
   - The main purpose of this test case is to verify that the web application correctly handles the scenario where a user tries to add a new course without providing essential information such as the course title and course code. The test ensures that appropriate error messages are displayed to prompt the user to enter the required details before proceeding with course creation.

2024-10-28 11:45:25,404:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Based on the provided information, here is the comparison of the main elements between the old and new versions:

1. "Username" - In the old version, the xpath was "//*[@id="login"]" and in the new version, it is "//*[@id="login"]". The element name changed from "Username" to "User name".
2. "Password" - No change in the xpath between the old and new versions.
3. "Enter" - In the old version, the xpath was "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/fieldset/button" and in the new version, it is "//*[@id="rightSidebar"]/div/form/fieldset/input[3]". The location and structure of the element changed significantly.
4. "Lost password" - In the old version, the xpath was "//*[@id="loginBox"]/p/a[1]" and in the new version, it is "//*[@id="rightSidebar"]/div/p/a[1]". The location of the element changed.
5. "Create user account" - In the old version, the xpath was "//*[@id="loginBox"]/p/a[2]" and in the new version, it is "//*[@id="rightSidebar"]/div/p/a[2]". The location of the element changed.
6. "Search from keyword" - Not present in the new version.
7. "Search" - Not present in the new version.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is the change in the xpath of the "Enter" button. In the old version, the xpath was "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/fieldset/button", but in the new version, it is "//*[@id="rightSidebar"]/div/form/fieldset/input[3]". This significant change in the location and structure of the element caused the test case to fail as the test script was unable to locate the element in the new version.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in element names from "Username" to "User name" may also cause test case failures if the test script references the old element name.
2. Removal of elements "Search from keyword" and "Search" in the new version may also cause failures if the test script interacts with these elements.

To resolve the test case failures, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in element locations, names, and any removed elements in the new version of the web application.

Test intent: 
The test case "TestAddEmptyCourse" is aiming to verify the functionality of adding a new course on a web application. The test case sets up the initial conditions by logging in with the admin user credentials, navigating to the page to create a new course, attempting to submit the form without filling in the required course title and course code fields, and then verifying that appropriate error messages are displayed on the page.

Test operation intent:
1. Open the web browser and navigate to the base URL.
2. Log in with the admin user credentials.
3. Click on the "Create a course site" link.
4. Click on the button to change course properties without entering the course title and course code.
5. Get the error messages displayed on the page for the missing course title and course code.
6. Assert that the error messages contain the expected text "Course title needed" and "Course code needed".

2024-10-28 11:48:27,087:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes that might have caused the test case failure:

1. "Linked categories" options have been updated in the new version, with new options like "Sciences," "Economics," "Humanities," and "Mathematics" added and the previous options like "Test2" and "Test" removed. This change could potentially impact the test case if it relied on the presence of the old options.

2. The structure of the "Linked categories" dropdown seems to have changed from a single dropdown with multiple options to two separate lists for linked and unlinked categories in the new version. This change in structure could also affect the test case if it interacted with the dropdown in a specific way.

3. The "Allowed with enrolment key" option in the "registration" section now includes an additional input box for entering the enrolment key. This change could affect the test case if it expected the enrolment key input to behave differently.

4. The "Maximum number of students" field has been renamed to "Maximum number of users" in the new version. This change in field name could cause the test case to fail if it relied on the old field name.

5. The "Available" status section has been expanded in the new version to include additional fields for specifying the availability dates. This change could impact the test case if it interacted with the availability status in a specific way.

6. The error message indicates that the element with the CSS selector "button[type="submit"]" could not be located. This element was not mentioned in the list of major elements for either the old or new version, which suggests it might be a new element added in the updated version causing the test case to fail.

Based on the changes mentioned above, the most likely root cause for the test case failure could be the addition of the new element with the CSS selector "button[type="submit"]." The test case might be trying to interact with this new element, which was not present in the old version, leading to the NoSuchElementException error.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in element locators, structure, or behavior of existing elements, as well as modifications in the workflow or functionality of the web application itself. It is recommended to review and update the test case to accommodate these changes in the new version of the web application.
