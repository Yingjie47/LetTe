**Test Intent:**  
The test case `TestUserList.java` is aimed at testing the functionality of accessing the user list in the platform administration section of a web application.  

**Test Case Operation Intent:**
1. **Setup:**  
   - Set up the Chrome driver and navigate to the base URL of the application.

2. **Test Scenario:**  
   - Enter the login credentials for the admin user.
   - Click on the submit button to log in.
   - Navigate to the "Platform administration" section.
   - Click on the "User list" link.

3. **Verification:**  
   - Verify that the text "admin" is present in the body of the page.

Overall, the test case focuses on verifying that after logging in as an admin user and navigating to the user list section, the page displays the text "admin" in the body content.

2024-10-28 23:38:01,455:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Enter" button element has changed significantly between the two versions:

Old Version:
3. "Enter" xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/fieldset/button"

New Version:
3. "Enter" xpath="//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]"

The significant change in the "Enter" button element is likely the root cause of the test case failure. In the old version, the "Enter" button was located within a specific path under the claroBody element, whereas in the new version, it has been moved to be a direct child of the loginBox element.

The error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}" indicates that the test case is trying to locate a button element using a CSS selector with the attribute "type" set to "submit", which does not exist in either the old or new version of the application.

Possible reasons for the failure of the test case:
1. The test case is trying to interact with a button element using a CSS selector that does not match any elements in the application.
2. The test case is not updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the application, specifically the change in the location of the "Enter" button.
3. The test case may need to be updated to use the correct XPath for locating the "Enter" button in the new version of the application.

To resolve the test case failure, the test case script needs to be updated to use the correct XPath for locating the "Enter" button in the new version of the application. The test case script should be modified to reflect the changes in the element structure between the old and new versions of the application.
