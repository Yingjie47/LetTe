Test Intent: The test case AddAreaTest.java is aiming to test the functionality of adding a new area in the web application. 

The test case first sets up the environment by opening the Chrome browser, navigating to the base URL, and logging in as an administrator. After logging in, it navigates to the Admin section of the application.

In the test method addAreaTest(), a new area named "Area New" is entered into the input field, and then the "Add Area" button is clicked. The test then verifies if the newly added area "Area New" is displayed on the page by asserting that the text matches the expected value.

The test case is checking if the application successfully adds a new area and displays it on the page as expected.

2024-10-30 23:32:46,811:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
The main elements that have changed between the old and new versions are:

Old Version:
1. "Name" xpath="/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input"
2. "Password" xpath="/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/input"
3. "Log in" xpath="/html/body/form/input[4]"

New Version:
1. "Name:" xpath="//*[@id="NewUserName"]"
2. "Password:" xpath="//*[@id="NewUserPassword"]"
3. "Log in" xpath="//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input"

From the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"/html/body/form/input[3]"}

The error message indicates that the element at xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]" could not be located, which corresponds to the "Log in" button in the old version.

Root Cause:
The main reason for the test case failure is that the xpath for the "Log in" button has changed between the old and new versions. In the old version, the xpath was "/html/body/form/input[4]", while in the new version, it is "//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input". This change in xpath caused the test case to fail as it could not locate the "Log in" button in the new version.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Element identification strategy changed: The new version uses different element identification strategies (id selectors instead of absolute xpaths), making the test case fail to find the elements based on the old xpaths.
2. Structural changes in the DOM: The structure of the form or page might have changed in the new version, leading to different xpaths for the elements.
3. Missing elements: The error message also suggests that the element at xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]" was not found, indicating potential missing elements or changes in the element order between versions.

To address the test case failure, update the test script with the new xpaths for the elements in the new version or modify the element identification strategy to adapt to the changes. It's essential to regularly review and update test scripts when the application undergoes changes to ensure their effectiveness.

2024-10-30 23:37:02,181:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Oct 30" with xpath="/html/body/a" is no longer present in the new version. This removal of the element "Oct 30" is likely the root cause of the test case failure. The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with the xpath "//a[text()='Admin']" which is not found in either the old or new versions provided.

There are several possible reasons for the test case failure:
1. Element removal: The removal of the element "Oct 30" in the new version could have caused the test case to fail if it was being interacted with or checked for in the test case.
2. XPath changes: The xpath for the elements has changed significantly between the old and new versions. If the test case is using hardcoded xpaths that are no longer valid in the new version, it will result in element not found errors.
3. New elements: The addition of new elements like "Go To Day Before", "Go To Today", and others in the new version could also impact the test case if it was not updated to interact with these new elements.

To resolve the test case failure, the test case needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. This includes updating xpaths to match the new elements, removing references to any removed elements, and adding interactions with any new elements that are now present. Additionally, it's important to review the test case logic to ensure it aligns with the current functionality of the web application.

The test verifies that after adding the area, it appears correctly on the page by checking if the added area name matches the expected value "Area New".

Overall, the test case is focused on verifying that the system allows the administrator to successfully add a new area and that the added area is displayed as expected on the page.

2024-10-30 23:40:54,829:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. In the old version, there was an element with xpath "//*[@id="content"]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/form/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/input" for entering the area name, which was used for adding a new area. However, in the new version, this element is no longer present. Instead, a new element with xpath "//*[@id="area_name"]" is introduced for entering the area name.

Based on the error message provided:
- The test case is trying to locate an element with xpath "//a[text()='Area New']", which suggests that it is trying to interact with a link/button related to the area functionality.
- The error "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element" indicates that the element with xpath "//a[text()='Area New']" could not be found in the new version of the application.

Root cause of test case failure:
The removal of the element for entering the area name in the new version is likely the root cause of the test case failure. Since the test case is trying to interact with an element related to the area functionality that no longer exists in the new version, it results in the "NoSuchElementException" error.

Other possible reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in element locators: The xpath of elements related to adding areas and rooms have changed in the new version. If the test case is using hardcoded xpaths that are no longer valid in the new version, it could lead to test case failures.
2. Changes in page structure: The structure of the page where the area and room functionalities are located may have been redesigned in the new version, causing the test case to fail due to elements being moved or rearranged.
3. Changes in functionality: The functionality related to adding areas and rooms may have been redesigned or re-implemented in the new version, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual behavior of the application.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version, such as using the correct element locators and adapting to the redesigned functionality.
