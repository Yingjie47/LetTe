Test Intent: The test case AddMultipleRoomTest.java is designed to test the functionality of adding multiple rooms to a system while logged in as an administrator.

Test Case Operation Intent:
1. Set up the test environment by logging in as the administrator.
2. Add a room named "New Room" with a description "Nice Room1" and a capacity of 10.
3. Verify the successful addition of the first room by checking if the room details are displayed correctly.
4. Add a second room with the same name "New Room" but with a different description "Nice Room2" and the same capacity of 10.
5. Verify the successful addition of the second room by checking if the room details are displayed correctly.

2024-10-31 09:35:15,701:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
By comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. "Name" element:
   - Old version: xpath="/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="NewUserName"]"

2. "Password" element:
   - Old version: xpath="/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/input"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="NewUserPassword"]"

3. "Log in" element:
   - Old version: xpath="/html/body/form/input[5]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input"

Based on the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"/html/body/form/input[3]"}

The root cause of the test case failure is the change in the xpath for the "Log in" element from the old version to the new version. In the old version, the xpath for the "Log in" button was "/html/body/form/input[5]", while in the new version, it is "//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input". As a result, the test case is unable to locate the "Log in" button in the new version using the old xpath ("/html/body/form/input[3]"), leading to a NoSuchElementException.

Other reasons for test case failure could include:
- Changes in the page structure or layout impacting the xpath of the elements.
- Changes in the IDs or classes of the elements.
- Changes in the form fields or buttons that require updating the test scripts.

To resolve the test case failure, update the xpath for the "Log in" button in the test script to match the new version's xpath ("//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input"). Additionally, ensure that other elements' xpaths are also updated to reflect the changes in the new version.

The test case AddMultipleRoomTest.java aims to test the functionality of adding multiple rooms to a web application. The test case sets up the environment by logging in as an administrator and navigating to the admin section. It then adds two rooms with different details (name, description, capacity) and verifies if the first room added is displayed correctly on the page by checking its presence.

The test case operation intent is to verify that the system allows the administrator to successfully add multiple rooms with unique details and that the added room information is correctly displayed on the page for further management. The test ensures that the rooms are added as expected and that the system can handle adding multiple rooms without errors.

2024-10-31 09:39:53,221:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the main difference is in the xpath of the elements. In the old version, the elements were located inside the "test_table" with a specific hierarchy, whereas in the new version, the elements are located inside "day_main" with a different hierarchy. This change in xpath structure is the root cause of the test case failure.

Specifically, the first element "07:00" was located at xpath "//*[@id="test_table"]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr/td/center/a/img" in the old version, but in the new version, it is located at "//*[@id="day_main"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/div/a". This change in xpath caused the test case to fail as the automation script was looking for the element in the old xpath location which no longer exists in the new version.

The error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[text()='Admin']"}" further confirms that the test case failed because the element with the xpath specified in the automation script could not be found in the new version of the application.

In order to fix the test case, the automation script needs to be updated with the new xpaths corresponding to the elements in the new version of the application. By updating the xpaths in the automation script to match the new version's element locations, the test case should be able to locate and interact with the elements correctly.

2024-10-31 09:42:45,643:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
From the provided information, we can see that the major elements for adding an area and room in the old version and the new version have changed significantly. The key changes are as follows:

1. **Add Area Element**:
   - Old Version: "Name:" text field and "Add Area" button were located within a table structure using specific xpaths.
   - New Version: "Name:" text field and "Add Area" button are now located outside the table structure and have different xpaths.

2. **Add Room Elements**:
   - Old Version: Separate text fields for name, description, and capacity along with the "Add Room" button were located within a table structure using specific xpaths.
   - New Version: All the elements for adding a room are located within a fieldset structure and have different xpaths.

The error message provided indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element using an xpath that is no longer present in the new version of the application. Specifically, the xpath "/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/ul/li[1]/a[1]" is not part of the new version's elements, which is causing the "NoSuchElementException."

The main reason for the test case failure is that the element structure and xpaths have been completely changed between the old and new versions. In this case, the removal of the first element related to adding an area (xpath="/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/form/input") is likely the root cause of the failure as it indicates a major restructuring of the elements.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the application's HTML structure or CSS classes affecting element identification.
- Improper synchronization or timing issues in locating the elements.
- Inadequate waits or delays in the test script causing elements to not be found.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpaths corresponding to the elements in the new version of the application. Additionally, ensuring proper synchronization and waits in the script can help prevent similar failures in the future.

Test Intent: The test case AddMultipleRoomTest.java is testing the functionality of adding multiple rooms in a web application. 

Test Case Operation Intent: 
1. The test case sets up the environment by logging in as an administrator and navigating to the "Rooms" section of the application.
2. Within the @Test method addMultipleRoomTest(), the test performs the following steps:
   a. Adds the first room by filling in the room name, description, and capacity fields and clicking on the "Add Room" button.
   b. Adds the second room in a similar manner as the first room.
   c. Verifies that the first room added is displayed correctly by asserting that the room name, description, and capacity are as expected.

Overall, the test case aims to validate the functionality of adding multiple rooms and ensuring that the room details are saved and displayed correctly in the application.

2024-10-31 09:48:23,765:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old version and the new version, we can see that the main changes are in the structure and naming conventions of the elements. 

In the old version:
- Elements related to adding areas and rooms were directly under the main table structure.
- The elements were identified using xpaths based on the table structure and form elements.

In the new version:
- The elements related to areas and rooms are now organized under different forms.
- The elements are identified using xpaths that reflect the new form structure and naming conventions.

Based on the error message provided, the root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the change in the structure and naming conventions of the elements. The specific element that was not found in the new version and likely the root cause of the failure is the element with the xpath "//li[text()='New Room(Nice Room1, 10) (']".

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the functionality: The new version might have introduced new features or changed the behavior of existing features, causing the test case to fail due to unexpected interactions.
2. Changes in the user interface: The layout, styling, or design of the application might have been updated, leading to the test case failing to interact with elements correctly.
3. Changes in the navigation flow: The flow of navigating through the application might have been altered, causing the test case to fail to reach the expected page or element.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the structure and naming conventions of the elements in the new version. Additionally, any changes in functionality, user interface, or navigation flow should be considered and incorporated into the test script as needed.

2024-10-31 09:50:16,273:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. In the old version, there was an element related to adding an area with "Name:" and "Add Area" button.
   In the new version, this was replaced with "Area:" and "Add Area" button elements.

2. In the old version, there were elements related to adding a room with "Name:", "Description:", "Capacity:", and "Add Room" button.
   In the new version, these were replaced with "Name:", "Description:", "Capacity:", and "Add Room" button elements.

Based on the error message provided:
```
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//li[text()='New Room(Nice Room1, 10) (']"}
```

The error message indicates that the test case is failing due to the inability to locate an element with the given XPath selector. The XPath selector `//li[text()='New Room(Nice Room1, 10) (` seems to be related to a list item that might be part of the new version's interface.

Given the changes in the major elements between the old and new versions, it is highly likely that the element associated with this XPath selector was added in the new version and is not present in the old version. This addition of a new element that the test case is trying to interact with but cannot find is the root cause of the test case failure.

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the structure of the web page impacting the XPath selectors used in the test cases.
- Changes in the functionality or behavior of elements impacting the test case flow.
- Updates in the application logic that require modifications to the test scripts.

To address the test case failure, you should update the test case to reflect the changes in the new version's elements and adjust the XPath selectors accordingly to interact with the correct elements.
