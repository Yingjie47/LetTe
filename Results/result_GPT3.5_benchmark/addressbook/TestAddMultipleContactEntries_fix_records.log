Test Intent: The test case "TestAddMultipleContactEntries.java" is testing the functionality of adding multiple contact entries to an address book application. The test case intends to verify that the user can successfully input contact information such as first name, last name, company, address, phone number, email, birthday, etc., for multiple contacts in the address book. 

The test case sets up the environment by initializing the WebDriver and navigating to the specified base URL. It then reads contact data from a file, iterates over each contact entry, enters the contact details into the corresponding input fields on the web page, submits the form, and verifies that a success message is displayed indicating that the information was entered into the address book.

Overall, the test case aims to ensure that the contact entry functionality works correctly for multiple contacts without any errors.

2024-10-25 21:21:23,737:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following elements have been removed or restructured in the new version:

1. "Company:" has been removed.
2. "Fax:" has been removed.
3. "Homepage:" has been removed.
4. "Notes:" has been removed.
5. "Address:" has been changed to "Secondary Address:".
6. "Home:" has been changed to "Secondary Home:".
7. "Enter" button at the end has been retained but its xpath has changed.

Based on the error message provided, it states that there is no element found with the xpath `//INPUT[@type='text'])[11]`. In the old version, the 11th input field was "E-mail2:" which is no longer present in the new version. This suggests that the removal of the "E-mail2:" field is the likely root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the xpath of elements causing the automation script to not locate the elements correctly.
- Removal of elements leading to missing data input points or validation checks.
- Changes in the sequence of elements causing the automation script to interact with the wrong fields.

To address this issue, the automation script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the application's elements and structure. Specifically, the part of the script interacting with the "E-mail2:" field needs to be modified or removed to align with the new version of the application. Additionally, any xpath references that have changed need to be updated in the script as well.

2024-10-25 21:26:47,487:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the most significant change that stands out is the removal of the "Fax" field in the new version. Given that the error message specifically mentions an issue locating the 11th input element of type 'text' (//INPUT[@type='text'])[11], it is highly likely that the "Fax" field, which was the 11th input element in the old version, being removed is the root cause of the test case failure.

The error message indicates that the test script is trying to locate the 11th input element of type 'text', which no longer exists in the new version. This discrepancy in element structure between the old and new versions leads to the "NoSuchElementException" error.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the form structure: The rearrangement or removal of elements within the form may have affected the sequence in which elements are accessed by the test script.
2. Changes in element attributes: The attributes of the remaining elements may have been altered in the new version, causing the test script to fail in locating the elements based on the old attributes.
3. Changes in element identifiers: If the identifiers (such as IDs or xpaths) of the remaining elements have been modified, the test script may not be able to locate them correctly.

In summary, the removal of the "Fax" field, which was the 11th input element in the old version, is likely the root cause of the test case failure. Other reasons could include changes in form structure, element attributes, and element identifiers between the old and new versions.

Since the error message indicates that the 11th input element of type 'text' cannot be located, and the "Fax" field, which was the 11th input element in the old version, has been removed in the new version, we need to adjust the XPath to target the correct input element for the email.

Here is the fixed version of the failing statement in the test case:

```java
driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//INPUT[@type='text'])[8]")).sendKeys(list.get(i).getEmail());
```

Explanation:
- The XPath index `(//INPUT[@type='text'])[8]` corresponds to the email input field in the new version HTML structure based on the provided HTML.
- By changing the index to 8, we are targeting the correct input field for entering the email address in the updated version of the web application.

The broken statement in the test case is trying to locate the 11th input element of type 'text' using the xpath "(//INPUT[@type='text'])[11]", which is no longer valid in the new version of the web application. 

To fix this issue, we need to update the xpath to correctly locate the input field for the email address in the new version. Based on the new version HTML provided, the xpath to locate the email input field is "//input[@name='email']".

Fixed broken statement:
```java
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@name='email']")).sendKeys(list.get(i).getEmail());
``` 

By updating the xpath to locate the email input field correctly in the new version, we address the "NoSuchElementException" error and ensure that the test script can input the email address as intended.

```

Repaired Statement:

```

Explanation:
In the new version of the application, the "Fax" field (which was the 11th input element in the old version) has been removed. To fix the broken statement, I have updated the XPath to locate the "Email2" input field (the first occurrence of this input field) in the new version. This change ensures that the test script can locate and interact with the correct input field for entering the year information.

2024-10-25 21:28:12,714:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, it is evident that the element "Homepage:" with xpath "//*[@id="content"]/form[1]/input[11]" is missing in the new version. This removal of the "Homepage" field is likely the root cause of the test case failure as indicated by the error message mentioning "(//INPUT[@type='text'])[11]".

The root cause and other reasons for the test case failure can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Root Cause - Missing Element:**
   - The error message indicates that the test is trying to locate the 11th input element with the type 'text', which was previously associated with the "Homepage" field. Since the "Homepage" field is no longer present in the new version, the test case fails to locate this element, resulting in a `NoSuchElementException`.

2. **Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:**
   - **XPath Changes:** The xpaths of several elements have changed between the old and new versions. This could also lead to failures if the test cases are referencing the old xpaths.
   - **Element Sequence:** The sequence of elements has changed in the new version. The missing "Homepage" field might have shifted the position of subsequent elements, causing the test case to interact with the wrong elements.
   - **Form Structure:** The structure of the form might have been modified in the new version, impacting how elements are accessed and interacted with by the test case.
   - **Field Renaming:** Some fields might have been renamed in the new version, leading to failures if the test cases are still using the old field names.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. Specifically, the test case should be modified to handle the absence of the "Homepage" field and adjust any references to the removed element. Additionally, any xpath changes or structural modifications should be accounted for in the test script to ensure its compatibility with the new version of the web application.

2024-10-25 21:29:11,808:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Company" field was removed in the new version. 

Root Cause:
The root cause of the test case failure is that the "Company" field was present in the old version (element 4), but it was removed in the new version. This change led to the test case trying to locate an element that no longer exists, resulting in the "NoSuchElementException" error.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Element Position Changes: In the new version, the positions of some elements have changed compared to the old version. For example, the positions of elements like "Address," "Home," "Mobile," "Work," "E-mail," "E-mail2," and "Group" have shifted. If the test case relies on specific element positions, these changes can cause failures.
   
2. Element Name Changes: The names of elements like "Enter," "Notes," and "Homepage" have changed or been removed in the new version. If the test case uses element names for identification, these changes can lead to failures.

3. Additional Elements: The new version introduces new elements like "Secondary Address" and "Secondary Home," which were not present in the old version. If the test case is not updated to handle these new elements, it may fail when interacting with them.

In summary, the primary reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "Company" field. However, other factors such as element position changes, element name changes, and the introduction of new elements can also contribute to test case failures when transitioning from the old version to the new version of the web application.

Broken Statement Fix:
The broken statement in the test case is trying to locate the "Company" field, which was removed in the new version. To fix this, we need to update the XPath to interact with the correct element in the new version.

Repaired Version:
```java
driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//INPUT[@type='text'])[4]")).sendKeys(list.get(i).getCompany());
```

Explanation:
In the new version of the application, the "Company" field was removed, so the test case should be updated to skip interacting with this field. By correcting the XPath index to [4], we ensure that the test case does not attempt to locate the non-existent "Company" field, resolving the "NoSuchElementException" error.

Please note that the repaired statement focuses on fixing the specific error related to the missing "Company" field and does not address other potential issues mentioned in the error analysis.

7. The "Enter" button is moved to a different position in the form.

The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate the 11th input field of type text, which is no longer present in the new version. This is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the xpath selectors due to the reorganization of elements in the form.
2. Renaming of certain fields causing the test case to look for elements with incorrect identifiers.
3. Removal of certain fields causing the test case to fail when trying to interact with those elements.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application. Specifically, the xpath selectors and the sequence of elements need to be adjusted according to the new structure of the form. Additionally, any references to removed elements should be updated or removed from the test script.
