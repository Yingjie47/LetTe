Explanation:
In the provided new version of the HTML, there is no `<div>` element with the attribute `align="left"` that contains an `<a>` anchor element linking to the Mantis Bug Tracker website with an associated image. Therefore, the exact operation performed on the old version element cannot be reproduced in the new version.

Additionally, the concept of using the `align` attribute on `<div>` elements for alignment purposes is considered outdated and not recommended in modern web development practices. Instead, CSS should be used for styling and layout purposes.
