2024-10-26 21:30:45,598:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the main change is the removal of the "Search from keyword" element in the new version. However, this change is not related to the error message provided. 

Looking at the error message: 
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}

The error indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element using a CSS selector with the attribute "type" set to "submit" but is unable to find it. This CSS selector is not present in the list of major elements provided for both the old and new versions.

Analyzing the major elements provided for the new version, the "Enter" element has been updated with a new xpath: "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]". This could be the cause of the test case failure as the test case might be looking for a button element with the type "submit" but the new version has an input element instead.

Therefore, the root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the change in the "Enter" element from a button to an input field, resulting in the test case being unable to locate the element with the expected CSS selector.
