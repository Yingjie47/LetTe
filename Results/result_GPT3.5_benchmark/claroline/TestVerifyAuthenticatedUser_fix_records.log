Test Intent: The test case TestVerifyAuthenticatedUser.java is intended to verify the functionality of an authenticated user logging into a web application. The test case sets up the ChromeDriver, navigates to the base URL, enters the admin user credentials, clicks on the submit button, verifies the presence of specific text on the page, and then navigates to the user's messages page to verify the page title.

Overall, the test case aims to ensure that an authenticated user can successfully log in, see specific content on the page, and access their messages without any errors.

2024-10-28 23:40:55,645:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
The main elements that changed between the old and new versions are as follows:
1. "Username" xpath: In the old version, the xpath was "//*[@id="login"]", while in the new version, it changed to "//*[@id="login"]".
2. "Enter" xpath: In the old version, the xpath was "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/fieldset/button", and in the new version, it changed to "//*[@id="loginBox"]/div/form/fieldset/input[3]".

The root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the change in the "Enter" button's xpath. In the old version, the xpath was pointing to a button within a specific structure, whereas in the new version, the xpath points to an input element within a different structure. This difference in the xpath caused the test case to fail as it was unable to locate the element using the old xpath.

Additionally, the error message indicates that the test case was trying to locate a button element using a CSS selector with the attribute "type" set to "submit", but it was unable to find such an element. This further confirms that the "Enter" button's xpath change is likely the primary reason for the failure.

To resolve this issue, the test case needs to be updated with the new xpath for the "Enter" button in the new version of the web application. The test script should be modified to use the updated xpath to interact with the element successfully and continue the test flow.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the following observations can be made:

1. In the old version, the element "View my statistics" was located at xpath "//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/div/a", while in the new version, it is located at xpath "//*[@id="userProfile"]/div[2]/p[1]/a". This change might have affected the test case if the test script was looking for "View my statistics" at the old xpath.

2. The error message indicates that the element with link text "Show/Hide" could not be located. This element is not present in the provided major elements of either the old or new versions. It is possible that this element was added in the updated version and the test script is trying to interact with it, leading to the NoSuchElementException.

3. Other changes in the major elements include the addition of new elements such as "Edit" and "Edit text zone" in the new version, which were not present in the old version. If the test script is interacting with these new elements, it may lead to failures if not handled properly.

Based on the provided information and the error message, the most likely root cause of the test case failure is the change in the xpath of the "View my statistics" element. Additionally, the NoSuchElementException for the "Show/Hide" element suggests that the test script may need to be updated to handle any new elements introduced in the updated version of the web application.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following main changes have occurred:

1. In the old version, there was an element "Manage my account" with the xpath "//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/div[2]/a". However, in the new version, this element is missing.
2. In the old version, the element "View my statistics" had the xpath "//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/div/a", but in the new version, it has been changed to "//*[@id="userProfile"]/div[2]/p[1]/a".
3. In the old version, the element "CS213 - Computer Science" had the xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a", but in the new version, there is no direct equivalent element.

Based on the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"link text","selector":"Show/Hide"}", we can infer that the test case is trying to interact with an element with link text "Show/Hide" which is not present in either the old or new version major elements.

The root cause of the test case failure is likely the missing element "Manage my account" in the new version. Since the test case is not able to locate this element in the new version, it fails with a NoSuchElementException.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the xpaths of elements like "View my statistics" and "CS213 - Computer Science" which may have caused the test case to not locate these elements correctly in the new version.

To fix the test case, you will need to update the element locators in the test script to match the new xpaths of the elements in the new version. Additionally, you should remove any interactions with elements that are no longer present in the new version, such as "Manage my account".

Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, the key change that stands out is the removal of the element related to "Show/Hide" in the new version. This element was not present in the list of major elements provided for both versions.

The root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to this missing element. The test case might have been interacting with the "Show/Hide" element in the old version, which is no longer available in the new version. As a result, when the test case tries to locate or interact with this element in the new version, it fails with the error message "NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element."

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the XPath: The XPath of several elements has been updated in the new version. If the test case is relying on specific XPaths that have changed, it could lead to element not found errors.
2. Structural changes: The structure of the elements in the left sidebar and content sections has been reorganized in the new version. If the test case is dependent on the old structure, it may fail to locate elements in the new layout.
3. New elements introduced: The new version introduces new elements such as "Hello," "Edit," and additional course creation links. If the test case is not updated to handle these new elements, it may cause failures.

To address the test case failures, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the application's elements, XPaths, and structure. Specifically, the test case should be modified to interact with the elements present in the new version and remove any references to the missing "Show/Hide" element. Additionally, it is essential to review and update any other locator strategies or interactions impacted by the changes in the application's UI.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the first element that stands out as being removed in the new version is "CS213 - Computer Science" with xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a".

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the removal of the "CS213 - Computer Science" element from the new version of the web application. This element was a key part of the test case, and its absence caused the test case to fail when trying to locate it using the old xpath.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Change in Element Location: The locations of several elements have changed between the old and new versions. For example, "Create a course site" was previously located under "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a" but is now located under "//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[1]/a". This change in location could have also caused the test case to fail if not updated accordingly.

2. Additional Elements: The new version introduces additional elements such as "Edit" and "Edit text zone" which were not present in the old version. These new elements could potentially interfere with the test case flow if not accounted for in the test script.

3. Error Message: The error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"link text","selector":"Show/Hide"}" indicates that the test script is trying to locate an element by link text "Show/Hide" which is not present in either the old or new version. This could be a potential bug in the test script or a leftover code from a previous version.

Overall, the test case failure is primarily due to the removal of the "CS213 - Computer Science" element and changes in element locations between the old and new versions of the web application. The test script needs to be updated to reflect these changes in order to pass successfully.

Based on the provided information, the main elements that have changed between the old and new versions are as follows:

1. The xpath for "Create a course site" has changed from `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[1]/a` in the new version.
2. The xpath for "Enrol on a new course" has changed from `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[1]/ul/li[2]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[2]/a` in the new version.
3. The xpath for "Remove course enrolment" has changed from `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[1]/ul/li[3]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[3]/a` in the new version.
4. The xpath for "All platform courses" has changed from `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[1]/ul/li[4]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[4]/a` in the new version.
5. The xpath for "New items to another date" has changed from `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[1]/ul/li[5]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[5]/a` in the new version.
6. The xpath for "View my statistics" has changed from `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/div/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="userProfile"]/div[2]/p[1]/a` in the new version.
7. The xpath for "Manage my account" has been removed in the new version.

Based on the comparison, it is clear that the removal of the "Manage my account" element is the most likely root cause of the test case failure. The error message `org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"link text","selector":"Show/Hide"}` indicates that the test case is trying to interact with an element that no longer exists in the new version of the application.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. The script should be modified to interact with the updated elements or handle the absence of the "Manage my account" element appropriately to prevent such NoSuchElementException errors.

From the provided information, we can see that the main elements of the old version and the new version have undergone significant changes. The first element removed in the new version is likely the root cause of the test case failure. Here is a comparison of the main elements between the old and new versions:

1. "Create a course site":
   - Old version: Located under `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a`
   - New version: Located under `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[1]/a`

2. "Enrol on a new course":
   - Old version: Located under `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[2]/a`
   - New version: Located under `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[2]/a`

3. "Remove course enrolment":
   - Old version: Located under `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[3]/a`
   - New version: Located under `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[3]/a`

4. "All platform courses":
   - Old version: Located under `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[4]/a`
   - New version: Located under `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[4]/a`

5. "New items to another date":
   - Old version: Located under `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[5]/a`
   - New version: Located under `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[2]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/h4/ul/li[5]/a`

Based on the error message provided, it states that the element "Show/Hide" could not be located. This element was present in the old version at `//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[1]/div/h1/a`, but it seems to have been removed in the new version. This missing element is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the element structure, such as different parent elements, different hierarchy levels, or changes in the element IDs and classes between the old and new versions. These changes can lead to element identification failures and cause the test case to fail.

The broken statement was trying to locate the element using link text "View all my messages". Since the error message reported a failure in finding the element "Show/Hide" using link text, it is unrelated to the broken statement. Therefore, the broken statement itself does not need to be fixed.
2024-10-28 23:49:17,651:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the key differences that stand out are:

1. The element "Show/Hide" with xpath "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[1]/div/h1/a" in the old version has been removed in the new version.
2. The xpath structure for elements related to course creation and actions has changed from "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="leftContent"]" in the new version.

Given the error message mentioning the absence of the element "Show/Hide" with the xpath from the old version, it is highly likely that its removal is the root cause of the test case failure. The test case might have been trying to interact with this element which is no longer present in the new version, leading to the NoSuchElementException error.

Additionally, the change in the xpath structure for course-related elements could also contribute to the test case failure if the test scripts were not updated to reflect these changes. Elements such as "Create a course site," "Enrol on a new course," "Remove course enrolment," etc., have different xpaths in the new version, which could result in element not found errors if the test scripts are still referencing the old xpaths.

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to use the correct xpaths for the elements in the new version. Specifically, any references to the removed element "Show/Hide" should be removed or updated with the relevant element in the new version. Additionally, the xpaths for course-related elements should be updated to match the new structure in the new version of the web application.

2024-10-28 23:49:27,839:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Based on the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Show/Hide" with the xpath "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[1]/div/h1/a" is no longer present in the new version. This missing element is likely the root cause of the test case failure indicated by the error message "NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element."

Other reasons for the test case failure may include:
1. Changes in the structure of the web page: The elements have been reorganized and their xpaths have been updated in the new version. Test cases that rely on specific xpaths from the old version will fail if those xpaths have changed.

2. Changes in the naming or labeling of elements: The text labels of some elements may have been updated in the new version, which could cause test cases expecting specific text to fail.

3. Changes in the hierarchy of elements: The hierarchy of elements may have been modified in the new version, resulting in different xpaths for the same elements. Test cases referencing old xpaths will fail to locate the elements in the new version.

To resolve the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application. This includes updating xpaths, element labels, and adjusting the test logic to accommodate any structural changes. Additionally, it is important to perform regression testing to ensure that other test cases are not impacted by the changes in the new version.

2024-10-28 23:49:49,883:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Show/Hide" with the xpath "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[1]/div/h1/a" present in the old version is missing in the new version. This removal of the "Show/Hide" element is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

The error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"link text","selector":"Show/Hide"}" confirms that the test case is failing because the element "Show/Hide" could not be located in the new version of the web application. This indicates that the test script is trying to interact with the "Show/Hide" element which is no longer available in the updated version, leading to the NoSuchElementException.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the xpath values of other elements such as "Create a course site", "Enrol on a new course", "Remove course enrolment", and "All platform courses". If the xpath values of these elements have also been updated in the new version and the test script is still referring to the old xpath values, it will result in element not found errors.

In conclusion, the removal of the "Show/Hide" element and potential changes in the xpath values of other elements are the main reasons for the test case failure in the updated version of the web application. The test script needs to be updated to reflect these changes in order to pass successfully.

Based on the comparison of the main elements between the old and new versions, the following changes can be observed:

1. "Show/Hide" element with xpath "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[1]/div/h1/a" was present in the old version but is not present in the new version.
2. The structure of the elements has changed between the old and new versions. In the old version, the elements were located under the xpath "//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a" for the navigation menu items and "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]" for the content section. In the new version, the elements are located under the xpath "//*[@id="leftContent"]" for both the navigation menu items and the content section.
3. The element "View all my messages" appears in two different locations in the old version but is consolidated under one location in the new version.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. Root Cause: The removal of the "Show/Hide" element from the new version is the most likely root cause of the test case failure as indicated in the note provided. The test case is likely trying to interact with this element, which no longer exists in the new version, leading to a "NoSuchElementException" error.
2. Structural Changes: The structural changes in the elements' location within the DOM between the old and new versions can also contribute to the test case failure. If the test case is referencing elements based on their old xpath locations, it will fail to locate them in the new version.
3. Consolidation of Elements: The consolidation of the "View all my messages" element under one location in the new version may also cause the test case to fail if it is interacting with this element using the old multiple xpath locations.

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the element locations and to remove any references to the removed element ("Show/Hide"). Additionally, the test case may need to be modified to account for the consolidated elements in the new version.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the elements related to "CS213 - Computer Science," "View my statistics," and "Manage my account" are no longer present in the new version. However, the error message provided does not directly reference any of these elements.

The error message specifically mentions an issue with locating an element using link text "Show/Hide," which is not listed in the provided major elements of either version. This discrepancy indicates that there might be additional elements or changes in the application that are not included in the provided major elements.

Given that the error message is related to locating an element using link text, it is possible that the test case is trying to interact with a "Show/Hide" link that was either newly added or modified in the new version but is not included in the provided major elements list. This could be the root cause of the test case failure.

To address the test case failure and accurately analyze the root cause, it is essential to identify and include all relevant elements, especially those that are directly referenced in the error messages or the test case steps. Additionally, reviewing the application changes, conducting a thorough element inspection, and updating the test cases accordingly can help prevent similar failures in the future.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the elements related to "CS213 - Computer Science," "View my statistics," and "Manage my account" are missing in the new version. However, since the error message specifically mentions "Show/Hide," which is not present in either version's major elements, we can assume that the element "New items to another date" might have been the root cause of the test case failure.

Here are the main reasons for the test case failure based on the comparison of major elements:
1. **Element Location Change:** The XPath of "New items to another date" has changed in the new version. In the old version, it was located under `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[5]/a`, whereas in the new version, it is located under `//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/ul/li[5]/a`. This change in location could lead to the test case failure as the test script may not be able to locate the element at the new XPath.

2. **Element Content Change:** The content of the elements seems to have remained the same, but their structure in the DOM has changed. This structural change could also cause the test case to fail as the test script might be looking for the elements in the old structure which no longer exists in the new version.

3. **Missing Elements:** Additionally, the elements "CS213 - Computer Science," "View my statistics," and "Manage my account" are missing in the new version. If the test case is dependent on interacting with these elements, their absence in the new version could also contribute to the failure.

In conclusion, the most likely root cause of the test case failure is the changed location of the "New items to another date" element in the new version, leading to the test script being unable to locate it. Other reasons include structural changes and missing elements that could impact the test case execution.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the elements related to "CS213 - Computer Science," "View my statistics," and "Manage my account" are missing in the new version. However, based on the error message provided, the element "Show/Hide" is mentioned, which is not present in either the old or new version elements.

The primary reason for the test case failure is most likely the removal of the "CS213 - Computer Science" element, which is the first removed element mentioned in the error message. This removal has caused the test case to fail as it could not locate this specific element in the new version of the application.

Additionally, it's important to note that the error message refers to an element with the link text "Show/Hide," which does not appear in the list of major elements for either the old or new versions. This discrepancy could indicate a potential issue with the test script or a new element introduced in the updated version that was not accounted for in the test case.

In summary, the root cause of the test case failure is likely the removal of the "CS213 - Computer Science" element, leading to the inability to locate the expected element during the test execution. The error message mentioning "Show/Hide" points to a potential discrepancy between the test script and the elements present in the application, highlighting the importance of updating test scripts to align with changes in the application's elements during version updates.

Updated Fixed Statement:
The error message indicates that the element "Show/Hide" was mentioned, which is not present in the new version of the application HTML. Since the "Show/Hide" element is not part of the major elements in either the old or new version, the most appropriate fix is to correct the element related to the error message. Therefore, the correct fixed statement should target the element "View all my messages" as shown above.

From the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions of the web application, we can see that the primary navigation elements have undergone a significant change in their xpaths. One key difference is that in the old version, the navigation elements were located under the xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[x]/a" whereas in the new version, they are under "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/ul/li[x]/a".

The error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"link text","selector":"Show/Hide"}" indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element by link text "Show/Hide" but it is unable to find it. This error is likely occurring because the element with the link text "Show/Hide" has been removed or its location has been changed in the new version of the application.

Given that the first element removed is most likely the root cause of the test case failure, we can infer that the "Show/Hide" element was present in the old version but has been removed in the new version. This change in the application's structure is causing the test case to fail as it is unable to locate the expected element.

To address this test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the new xpath or locator for the "Show/Hide" element in the new version of the application. By updating the test script with the correct locator for the element, the test case should be able to locate and interact with the element successfully, resolving the failure.

2024-10-28 23:52:52,394:INFO:Cause of failure 5 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the elements related to "CS213 - Computer Science", "View my statistics", and "Manage my account" are missing in the new version. However, the error message mentions an element with the link text "Show/Hide", which is not present in the provided major elements for both versions. 

Given the information provided, it appears that the element with the link text "Show/Hide" is not part of the listed major elements for either the old or new version. This discrepancy suggests that the test case is trying to interact with an element that is not included in the specified major elements, leading to the "NoSuchElementException" error.

Root Cause:
The removal of the "CS213 - Computer Science" element from the major elements of the new version is most likely the root cause of the test case failure. When the test case tries to locate and interact with this missing element, it results in the "NoSuchElementException" error.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in XPath: The XPath values for the major elements have changed between the old and new versions, which could also lead to test case failures if the test script is not updated accordingly.
2. Element Structure Changes: The structure of the elements in the left sidebar seems to have been reorganized in the new version, which could impact the element locators used in the test cases.
3. Missing Elements: Apart from the root cause, the absence of "View my statistics" and "Manage my account" elements in the new version could also cause related test cases to fail if they interact with these elements.

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated with the correct element locators based on the new version's structure, and any references to the removed elements should be adjusted or removed from the test cases.
