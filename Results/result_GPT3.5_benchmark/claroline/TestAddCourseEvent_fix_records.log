Test Intent: The test case "TestAddCourseEvent.java" is intended to automate the process of adding an event to a course in a web application. 

The test case sets up the environment by launching the Chrome browser, logging in with specific credentials, navigating to a specific course ("Computer Science"), accessing the course calendar, and then adding a new event named "Exam 001" with a specific date (26th December 2023). 

After adding the event, the test case verifies if the event was successfully added by checking if the message "Event added to the agenda." is displayed on the page.

Overall, the test case aims to ensure that the functionality of adding events to a course works correctly on the web application.

2024-10-26 22:25:16,023:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the two versions, it is evident that the "Search" button element is missing in the new version. This missing element is the likely root cause of the test case failure as indicated by the error message related to locating an element with the selector "button[type="submit"]".

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The "Search" button element (xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button") present in the old version is removed in the new version. This change in the element structure is causing the test case to fail as the test script is unable to locate and interact with the missing "Search" button.

Other Possible Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Element Renaming: The "Username" element is renamed to "User name" in the new version. If the test script is not updated to reflect this change, it might result in element not found errors.

2. Element Positioning: The "Enter" button element's xpath has changed in the new version. It has moved from "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button" to "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]". If the test script is relying on the old xpath, it will fail to interact with the "Enter" button.

3. Locator Changes: The new version might have introduced changes in the way elements are located or identified (e.g., using different xpaths or CSS selectors). If the test script is not updated to use the new locators, it will lead to element not found errors.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in element names, positions, and locators in the new version of the web application. Specifically, adding the "Search" button element back to the test script and updating the xpaths for elements that have changed will likely resolve the test case failure.

**Test Case Operation Intent:**

The test case `TestAddCourseEvent.java` is aimed at testing the functionality of adding a course event on a web application, specifically within a course management system. The test case utilizes Selenium WebDriver with Java to interact with the web elements and perform the necessary actions to add an event.

**Test Intent:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Set up the WebDriver to use Chrome browser and navigate to the base URL of the application.
   
2. **Test Steps:**
   - Log in using the provided admin user credentials.
   - Navigate to a specific course (Computer Science).
   - Click on the course calendar.
   - Click on the "Add an event" option.
   - Fill in the event details such as title, date (26th December 2023), and submit the event.
   
3. **Verification:**
   - Verify that the event has been successfully added by checking if the message "Event added to the agenda." is displayed on the page.
   
4. **Cleanup:**
   - There is no explicit cleanup step in the provided test case.

**Additional Notes:**
- The test case seems to focus on the positive scenario of adding an event, as it includes verification for the success message.
- The test does not handle any potential errors that may occur during the test execution.

2024-10-26 22:31:29,271:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Today" element from the old version is missing in the new version. This missing element is likely the root cause of the test case failure. 

Root Cause:
1. "Today" element is missing in the new version.
2. Error message indicates inability to locate an element that previously existed in the old version.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. XPath Changes: The XPath for elements like "Add an event", "Clear up event list", and "Download" have changed in the new version. This could lead to element not found errors if the test cases are still referring to the old XPaths.
2. Element Sequence Change: The sequence of elements has changed in the new version. For example, the order of elements in the list has changed, which might affect test case execution if the tests are dependent on specific element positions.
3. Element ID Changes: The IDs of elements like "edit" and "delete" have changed in the new version. Test cases referring to these elements by ID will fail due to the change.

Recommendation:
1. Update Test Cases: Update the test cases to reflect the changes in the new version, including updating XPaths, element IDs, and sequences.
2. Verify Element Existence: Ensure that all elements required for the test cases exist in the new version before executing the tests.
3. Use Dynamic Locators: Consider using more robust locators like CSS selectors or relative XPaths that are less likely to break when elements change.

By addressing the missing "Today" element and updating the test cases accordingly to adapt to the changes in the new version, the test case failures should be resolved.
