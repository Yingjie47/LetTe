2024-04-18 11:26:18,326:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
By comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Page Content" (xpath="//*[@id="page_content"]") is missing in the new version, which is the first element removed from the old version. This missing element is most likely the root cause of the test case failure.

The error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable" indicates that Selenium was unable to interact with the element during the test execution. This could be due to the element being missing from the new version of the web application, causing the test case to fail when trying to interact with it.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the UI/UX design: The layout and structure of the web application have been significantly updated in the new version, leading to changes in the locators of the elements. This can cause the test script to fail as it is unable to locate and interact with the elements using the old locators.

2. Element visibility or state: The missing element may still exist in the new version but could be hidden or disabled, making it uninteractable by the test script. This could result in the test case failing due to the element not being in the expected state for interaction.

3. Timing issues: If the test script is attempting to interact with the element before it is fully loaded or ready on the page, it could lead to an element not interactable error. This could be due to changes in the loading times or order of elements in the new version.

In summary, the test case failed primarily because the crucial element "Page Content" was removed in the new version, causing Selenium to throw an "ElementNotInteractableException" when trying to interact with it. Other reasons for the failure could include changes in UI/UX design, element visibility or state, and timing issues during test execution.

2024-04-18 11:26:32,575:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be seen that there is a discrepancy between the test case and the error message for the root cause of the failure. The error message refers to an element that is uninteractable, which is not the "Page Content" element. According to the new version of the HTML content, there is no "Page Content" element, and there is no corresponding element with such a high semantic level. This means that the "Page Content" element is not the root cause of the failure.
The new HTML does contain a <input> tag with an id of "page_title", and the error message in the test case contains the string "//*[@id="page_title"]", so it is very likely that this element is the one mentioned in the error message.
In addition, the new HTML does not contain any elements with the ids "admin_password" and "admin-login-form", which are mentioned in the test case, but these do not affect the subsequent test steps as there are no subsequent lines of code.
At the same time, by looking for the element id in the new HTML, it can be found that the id "save_and_close" does not exist, but there is an element with the id "save_and_close_button".
It should be noted that the test code line before the error line contains a test on a select element, which is almost certainly the cause of the failure of the test line, because the error line is a click action on a button element, which is definitely not an "ElementNotInteractable" exception.
Based on the possible reasons for test failure, you can deduce that there has been a change in the UI design of the new version of the application, which includes the removal of some elements, changes to some element properties (such as the renaming of the "save_and_close" element), and a change in the way the page is loaded.
In summary, to fix the test case, you need to delete the xpath statement of the "Page Content" element and the two lines of code that contain the "admin_password" and "admin-login-form" elements, and change the id of the "save_and_close" element to "save_and_close_button".

Based on the new version of the HTML, the "Page Content" element can still be found. Although the xpath is not completely consistent, it can be repaired by only changing the "td[6]" in the xpath to "td[7]".
The possible cause of the test failure is that the "Page Content" element is missing in the new version of the HTML, so the root cause of the test failure is that the xpath in the test case is not consistent with the error message, which is wrong.
At the same time, by analyzing the error message and understanding the test intent, it can be concluded that the "Page Content" element is not the root cause of the failure of the test case. Because in the error message, the word "element" is singular, which means that only one element cannot be interacted with, while the test case continues to execute in the subsequent "click" actions, and there is no error. So the root cause of the test failure should be the element located by the xpath "//*[@id="page_status"]/a".
So in order to fix the test case, it is necessary to change the xpath of the test case to locate the element "Page Content", and change "td[6]" in the subsequent xpath to "td[7]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

In addition, the error message contains a "ElementNotInteractableException" which indicates that the test is trying to interact with an element. So the new test case you provide should include a "click" action, not a "send_keys" action.
2024-04-18 11:26:32,576:INFO:The testcase 1-3 is generated:
The "Page Content" element mentioned in the analysis of possible causes of test failure is not found in the new version of the HTML.
By analyzing the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the "Page Content" element does not exist, and based on the test case and error message, it can be inferred that the root cause of the test failure is that the test case is trying to interact with an element with an id of "page_content" which does not exist in the new version of the HTML. So you need to change '//*[@id="page_title"]' in the test case to '//*[@id="page_content"]'.
According to the new version of the HTML, "Page Content" is indeed not found, but there is a "Page Title" element, and "Page Title" is very similar to "Page Content", so it is more likely to be the element mentioned in the error message.
In order to prevent the xpath from appearing in the error message, it is necessary to change the '//*[@id="page_title"]' in the test case to a xpath that can uniquely locate the "Page Title" element, and change it to '//*[@id="page_title"]' is the most direct way.

2024-04-18 11:26:32,576:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failures, we can see that the root cause of test failure is the missing of the "Page Content" element. This element is a text box used to edit the content of a page, and its removal will prevent the test case from proceeding. However, according to the new HTML you provided, there is no such element, nor any other new elements that have a similar function, so it is impossible to fix this test case by adding or changing an element.
In the new HTML you provided, I found a "Page Title" element with id="page_title" that is similar to the missing element in the test case, but this element is still there and can be interacted with, so it is not related to this test case.
By looking at the error message and the new HTML you provided, I found that the "Page Status" element has a similar id to the one mentioned in the error message, and the "Page Category" element has a "select2-results-3" element mentioned in the error message in its xpath, and both are likely to be relevant to the error.
In addition, in the new version of the HTML, I noticed that there is no "Save and Close" button with an id of "save_and_close", so the test case will fail at this step.

According to the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be inferred that the removal of the "Page Content" element is not the root cause, but the subsequent "Page Status" and "Page Category" elements may be related to the failure.
At the same time, it can be concluded that in order to fix the test case, you need to change the id of the "Save and Close" button to a new one.

By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure, it is found that the "Page Content" element does not exist in the new version of HTML, but the "Page Title" element does exist, which seems to be consistent with the original intent of the test case.
At the same time, according to the new version of the HTML, the xpath of the "Page Status" element is '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a', which is consistent with the xpath in the test case mentioned in the error message, so the root cause of the test failure is that it can't find the "Page Content" element.
So to fix the test case, you need to delete the test step for the "Page Content" element, and then change the xpath in the test case mentioned in the error message to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a".
In addition, there are two sleep(1) statements in the original test case that have been annotated. To make the new test case more stable, you can remove the two annotations.

2024-04-18 11:29:59,442:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
From the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions, the most noticeable change that could be the root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the element with the xpath "//*[@id="cpa"]/li[1]/a" which was the "Back" button in the old version.

Root Cause:
The error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable" indicates that Selenium was unable to interact with an element, meaning it could not perform actions like clicking or entering text into it. This error likely occurred because the "Back" button was removed in the new version, and the test case may have been trying to interact with this element, causing the failure.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Element Locator Changes: The xpath locators for elements have changed between the old and new versions. If the test case was using these xpaths to locate elements, it would fail as the xpaths have been updated.

2. Functionality Changes: The functionalities associated with the elements have also changed. For example, actions like saving a page, enabling TINYMCE, or managing page visibility have been replaced with new functionalities like publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages. If the test case was relying on the old functionalities, it would not work with the new version.

3. New Elements Introduced: There are new elements introduced in the new version such as checkboxes for "test", "Fixed layout", and "Small Sidebar". If the test case was not updated to include these new elements, it would not be able to interact with them, leading to failure.

4. Different User Flow: The layout and structure of the page seem to have been redesigned significantly between the old and new versions. If the test case was following a specific user flow based on the old layout, it may not align with the new layout, causing the test case to fail.

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. This includes updating element locators, adapting to new functionalities, incorporating new elements, and adjusting the user flow to match the new design.

According to the new HTML, the "Back" button has been removed. However, this cannot be the root cause of the test case failure, as the error message and the xpath in the test case containing "Back" do not match.
By analyzing the error message, it can be found that the xpath in the error message is similar to the xpath in the test case. It is speculated that the root cause of the test failure lies in the "Save and Close" button, which is the only one of the possible causes of failure that has a similar xpath to the one in the error message.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to change the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" in the test code to "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".
At the same time, according to the test case and the new version of the HTML content analysis, it can be found that the test case may be trying to change the page status to "test", but in the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that the "test" is not an option for page status. Therefore, to prevent future test failures, it is also necessary to remove the test case line that contains the xpath "//*[@id="s2id_page_cat"]/select/option[3]".

According to the possible reasons for the test failure you mentioned, it can be found that the "Back" button was not the root cause of the test failure, but the changes in the new version of the HTML code caused the test to fail.
By comparing the new version of the HTML with the test case, it can be found that there are new elements in the <form> tag with the id "cp_table", such as <input id="table_action" name="table_action" readonly="" type="hidden" value=""/> and <input name="fusion_tVIlNI" type="hidden" value=""/>, which may cause the subsequent test steps to fail.
So, to fix the test case, simply remove the xpath in the test case that is similar to "//*[@id="cpa"]/li[1]/a".
In addition, based on the possible reasons for test failure you mentioned, it can be inferred that to make the subsequent test steps work, you need to change the xpath "//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/a" in the test case to "//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/ul/li[2]/a".

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

Based on the possible causes of test failure, the root cause is the removal of the "Back" button.
However, by examining the new HTML source code, it was found that the "Back" button with id "cpa" was still in it.
Therefore, the "Back" button was not removed.
At the same time, the xpath in the error message was also found in the new HTML source code, and the element could be found.
So this is not the root cause of the test failure.

By analyzing the new HTML source code, it can be found that the id of the button that triggers the Save operation is "save_and_close", and the id of the element in the next line is "page_title". It is very likely that the test code is trying to enter text into the page title input box after clicking the "Save and Close" button, but it actually entered text into the "Status" drop-down box. This is likely to be the cause of the ElementNotInteractableException.
So to fix the test case, you need to switch the two lines of code.

The repaired test case is:

2024-04-18 11:30:12,511:INFO:The testcase 2-4 is generated:
According to the new version of the HTML, the element with id "cpa" was not removed, so it is not the root cause of the test case failure. At the same time, the xpath "//*[@id="cpa"]/li[1]/a" is not found in the new version of the HTML, so it does not affect the test case.
The test case interacts with the "Back" button before logging in and the error occurs when clicking the "Edit" button, which means that the error occurs after entering the admin panel.
At the same time, the error message in the new version of the HTML indicates that the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]" could not be interacted with, which means that the test line "driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")" failed.
The root cause of the test case failure can be inferred to be that the "Edit" button at the end of the test code was not found in the new version of the HTML, and the "Page Title" textbox before the "Edit" button could not be interacted with, which indicates that it could not be located.
So in order to fix the test case you need to change the xpath "//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/ul/li[2]/a" in the test code to something that matches the new HTML, and change the xpath '//*[@id="page_title"]' to "//*[@id="page_title-field"]/div/input" to ensure that the test case can find the target element.
The new test case should be:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be seen that there is no change in the xpath of the "Back" button, so it will not affect the test case. It can be excluded that the removal of the "Back" button caused the test case to fail.
According to the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the xpath expression of the element with id "save_and_close" has changed to "//*[@id="cp_table"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[6]/a[1]". So in order to fix the test case, you just need to update the xpath in the test case to "//*[@id="cp_table"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[6]/a[1]".

The repaired test case is:

2024-04-18 11:30:58,758:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that one significant change is the removal of the "Page Content" element from the old version and the addition of new elements like checkboxes for "test," "Fixed layout," and "Small Sidebar" in the new version. The error message indicates an "ElementNotInteractableException," suggesting that the test case failed because the automation script was unable to interact with a specific element.

Given the error message and the comparison of elements, the most likely root cause for the test case failure is the absence of the "Page Content" element in the new version. The automation script might be trying to interact with the "Page Content" element as it did in the old version, but since it no longer exists in the new version, the script is unable to locate it, resulting in the ElementNotInteractableException.

Other potential reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the structure of the web page, such as different XPath or CSS selector for the elements, changes in the behavior of certain elements (e.g., input fields being disabled or hidden), or dynamic loading of elements impacting their interactability.

To address the issue and fix the test case, you will need to update the automation script to interact with the new elements present in the new version of the web application. This includes identifying the appropriate locators (XPath, CSS selector, etc.) for the new elements and modifying the script accordingly. Additionally, reviewing the changes in the web page structure and behavior can help ensure that the automation script aligns with the updated version of the application.

2024-04-18 11:31:13,691:INFO:The testcase 3-1 is generated:
By understanding the test case and the possible reasons for the failure, we can see that the reported error occurs after the "Page Title" element is interacted with, which is in the same form as the "Page Status" element that the test case is required to interact with later, so the change in the new version of HTML may not be relevant to the error.
Looking at the new HTML, we can see that the "Page Content" element has been removed and some new elements have been added, such as the "test", "Fixed layout", and "Small Sidebar" checkboxes. We can also see that the id of the "Page Title" input box is "page_title", which is consistent with the error message in the test case.
So, to fix the test case you just need to delete the line of code in the test case that interacts with the "Page Content" element.

The repaired test case is:

In the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it was discovered that there is a change of a "Page Content" element in the new version of the HTML, but after checking the new version of the HTML, it was found that there is no "Page Content" element, so this is a mistake in the possible reasons.
In the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that there are actually more new elements in the HTML, such as the "test" checkbox mentioned in the possible reasons.
The error message in the test case shows that the element cannot be interacted with, so the root cause of the test failure should be that some elements cannot be found, rather than the element cannot be interacted with.
By understanding the intent of the test case and reviewing the new version of the HTML, you can see that there are elements similar to those that cannot be found in the error message. For example, in the new version of the HTML there is a "Page Title" element with an id of "page_title", in the test case there is a "Page Content" element with an id of "page_content". In addition, there is a change in the "Page Status" element. In the new version of the HTML, there are three options in the drop-down list, while in the error message, the test case is supposed to choose the second one.
So to fix the test case, just change '//*[@id="page_title"]' to '//*[@id="page_content"]', and change '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]' to '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[3]'.

The new version of the HTML does contain a "Page Content" element, and from the xpath in the error message, it can be seen that the error is caused by a specific element in the test case not being interactable.
So it is more likely that the change in the "Page Content" element has nothing to do with the test case failure. Instead, the addition of new elements such as "test," "Fixed layout," and "Small Sidebar" and the change in the status of other elements might be the reason why the test case failed.

By analyzing the test case, you can see that the test case first fills in the page title and then sets the page status. This is consistent with the sequence of elements in the "Page Content" form.
In addition, the error message indicates that the error occurred because an element could not be interacted with, so the subsequent test steps of the test case that try to interact with the element may be the root cause of the failure.

So, to fix the test case, you need to change the xpath of the element in the test case that contains "//*[@id="page_title"]" to "//*[@id="page_title"]" based on the new HTML, and change the xpath of the element that contains "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" to match the new HTML.
At the same time, you also need to change the xpath of the element in the test case that contains "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" to "//*[@id="s2id_page_cat"]/select" to prevent future errors caused by changes to the status options.
Finally, based on the possible reasons for the test failure you provided, the new version of the HTML code does not contain a "Page Content" element, so it is best to delete the test case line that tests for the "Page Content" element.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_cat"]/select').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()

By deleting the test case line that tests the "Page Content" element, the test case can be fixed and also avoid unnecessary test steps.

By looking at the new version of the HTML, I can see that indeed the "Page Content" element was not found, and three new elements were found: "test," "Fixed layout," and "Small Sidebar."
The "Page Content" element is no longer found in the new version of the HTML, which means that the automation script is unable to locate and interact with this element in the new version of the web application, so it will throw an error.
At the same time, according to the test case and the new HTML, I found that the "Page Title" element in the test case cannot be found in the new version of the HTML, which is also a possible reason for the error.
In addition, there are three new elements in the new version of the HTML that have the same attributes as the "Page Content" element in the original test case, so it is likely that these new elements are related to the error and need to be tested in the subsequent test cases. At the same time, the new elements also appear in the test cases that are not reported in the error message.
The new version of the HTML does not contain any elements with ids of "save_and_close" or "admin-login-form", but the reported error message contains no information about these two elements, so there is no need to test them in the subsequent test cases.

Based on the comparison of the major elements of the old and new versions, the first element that was removed in the new version is "Back" with the xpath "//*[@id="cpa"]/li[1]/a". This element is most likely the root cause of the test case failure as indicated by the error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable".

The test case may have been trying to interact with the "Back" button that is no longer present in the new version of the application. As a result, when the test case attempted to click or interact with the "Back" button using its xpath "//*[@id="cpa"]/li[1]/a", it failed to find the element, leading to the ElementNotInteractableException.

Other potential reasons for the test case failure could be:
1. Changes in the page structure: The removal of the "Back" button may have led to changes in the overall page structure, causing other elements to shift or become inaccessible to the test case.

2. Changes in element properties: The new version may have introduced changes in the properties or attributes of the elements, making them unrecognizable to the test case.

3. Changes in functionality: The functionality related to navigation or page transitions may have been redesigned or re-implemented in the new version, leading to the removal of the "Back" button.

To address the test case failure, you should update the test case to interact with the new elements and adjust any related test steps that were dependent on the presence of the "Back" button. Additionally, you may need to review the overall test script to identify and update any other impacted elements or interactions due to the changes in the application's interface.

The "Back" button was actually just a navigation link to the admin homepage, and this element is still present in the new version of the HTML.
By analyzing the new version of the HTML you can see that the id of the admin homepage navigation link is "ddadmin", not "dduser".
Based on this information, you can tell that the first part of the test case is to navigate to the admin homepage.
By comparing the new HTML with the test case, you can see that the id of the form element containing the admin password input box is "admin_password", which is consistent with the test case description in the intent, and that the "root1234" in the test case should be the value of the admin password input box.
In order to find the root cause of the ElementNotInteractableException, we can search the new version of the HTML for the elements that have an id of "page_title" and "page_status", and then analyze whether the xpath of the elements in the test case is consistent with the new version.
By comparing the new HTML with the test case, we can see that the id of the element that pops up when you click on the "Select status" drop-down box is "select2-results-3" instead of "select2-results-3" as mentioned in the test case.
In order to better understand the intent of the test, the id and xpath of the element that is clicked next in the test case are also searched for in the new version of the HTML, and no results are found, so it is likely that the test step is related to the part that has just been analyzed to interact with the "Select status".
The test case line that was supposed to interact with the "Back" button and the line that was supposed to enter the admin password had no impact on the error message, but because the id of the navigation link was changed, the xpath in the test case of the subsequent test step also needs to be changed accordingly.

2024-04-18 11:31:49,467:INFO:The testcase 4-3 is generated:
According to the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the "Back" button with xpath "//*[@id="cpa"]/li[1]/a" still exists.
So, the possible root cause of the test failure is wrong as "Back" button being removed. This can be ruled out.
By analyzing the failed test case and the error message, it can be concluded that the element that caused the error in the test case is "root" in the test case line of code "driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin_password"]')".
Based on the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the "root" element does not exist, but there is a very similar element "Admin Password" with xpath "//*[@id="admin_password"]".
Therefore, in order to fix the test case, you only need to change the xpath value of "root" to "Admin Password".

The "Back" element is not found in the new version of HTML, and the element "Add New Page" is the one most likely to be similar to it, but from a semantic point of view, it is not entirely the same as "Back".
Based on the test intent and the error message, it can be speculated that the root cause of the test failure is that the test case was trying to click on a "Back" button but failed, and then in the subsequent test step, the error message about the element not being clickable appeared.
However, by looking at the new version of the HTML, the element with the id "admin_password" does not exist, which is the first error mentioned in the test case, and the root cause of the test failure should be that the test case cannot input the "root1234" into the password input box.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to first change "//*[@id="admin_password"]" to "//*[@id="s2id_page_cat"]/select", and then delete the subsequent test steps that are dependent on the "Back" button.
At the same time, according to the new version of the HTML, you also need to change "//*[@id="page_title"]" to "//*[@id="page_title-field"]/input".

According to the new version of the HTML, the "Back" button still exists, but its xpath has changed to "//*[@id="cpa"]/li[1]/a".
The possible reasons for the test failure provided by you indicate that the "Back" button is the root cause of the test failure, but I believe this is not the case because the error message does not mention the "Back" button.
The error message says "element not interactable", which indicates that the element is not ready to be interacted with. So it can be inferred that there is a page loading or ajax request operation in the background, and the test case did not wait for the end of the operation before performing the element interaction.
So to fix this test case, you can add a wait for the element to appear or be clickable before line 15.
The new xpath of the "Save & Close" button is "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

2024-04-18 11:32:23,815:INFO:Cause of failure 5 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the first element removed from the old version is the "Back" button. Given that the error message indicates an "ElementNotInteractableException," it is highly likely that the removal of the "Back" button is the root cause of the test case failure.

Here are the reasons for the failure of the test case:

1. **Missing "Back" Button**: The "Back" button from the old version is no longer present in the new version. If the test case involved navigating back to a previous page or step using the "Back" button, its absence would lead to an "ElementNotInteractableException" error as the automation script would try to interact with a non-existent element.

2. **Element Identification Changes**: The xpaths for elements have changed between the old and new versions. If the test case script is using the xpaths from the old version to interact with elements in the new version, it would result in elements not being found or interactable, causing the test case to fail.

3. **Functionality Changes**: The actions performed by the elements in the old version might have been replaced by different elements or functionalities in the new version. If the test case script is trying to interact with elements that serve different purposes or have been replaced, it would lead to failures.

4. **Page Structure Changes**: The overall page layout and structure might have changed between the old and new versions. If the test case script relies on specific page elements or positions that have been altered or removed, it would result in the script being unable to interact with the elements as expected.

To address the test case failure, the automation script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. This includes updating element locators, adjusting navigation steps to accommodate changes in functionality, and ensuring that the script interacts with the correct elements based on the new version's structure.

By understanding the possible reasons for test failure and the new HTML, it can be found that the change of the "Back" button is not the root cause of the test failure, but the change of the subsequent elements. The test case reported an ElementNotInteractableException, and looking up the new HTML source code showed that the element with id "admin_password" is of type hidden, which is not interactable, so it can be concluded that this element caused the test failure.
So to fix this test case, you just need to delete the corresponding line of code in the test case.

By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be determined that the removal of the "Back" button is likely to be the root cause of the failure of this test case. However, this is not correct. The "Back" button mentioned in the possible cause of test failure is not related to the test case.
At the same time, according to the error message, it can be found that the test failed at the point of trying to interact with the element whose id is "page_title", and the subsequent test line is also trying to interact with an element related to "page_title", so it can be concluded that the root cause of the test failure is that the "page_title" element cannot be interacted with.
By analyzing the new version of the HTML, it can be found that there is a <button> element in the "page_title" element, and the type attribute is set to "submit", which is likely to be a button for submitting the form. And the error message in the test case is ElementNotInteractableException, so it can be inferred that the root cause of the test failure is that the test case tried to interact with the <button> element which is the submit button in the "page_title" element, but it failed.
So to fix the test case, you just need to delete the test code line that contains the xpath expression of the <button> element in the "page_title" element.
At the same time, by analyzing the new version of the HTML, it can be found that there is no element whose id is "save_and_close", which is contained in the test case. So if you want to run the repaired test case, you must delete the test code line that contains the xpath expression for the "save_and_close" element.
In addition, if the intent of the test case is to check if the "Back" button has been removed, then the test case should also be repaired to delete the test code line containing the xpath of the "Back" button.

Based on the new version of the HTML, "//*[@id="page_title"]" and "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" are still valid elements and are not related to the test case.
Looking at the error message and xpath, it can be seen that the test failed when it tried to click on an element, which means that it was not able to interact with the element. And according to the new version of the HTML, it can be found that there is no element with the id "save_and_close" in the entire HTML, and the most similar one is the "Publish" button in the "Add New Page" block, so it can be inferred that the error is due to the removal of this "Publish" button.
So to fix the test case, you need to delete the line of code in the test case that contains "//*[@id="save_and_close"]", and then change the xpath in the subsequent line of code to "//*[@id="page_title-append-btn"]".

By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, you can quickly identify the root cause of test failure. At the same time, you can see that the "Back" button was indeed removed.
The new HTML shows that the "Back" button has indeed been removed.
According to the possible reasons for the failure of the test case, the new version of the HTML is most likely to have changed the xpaths of the element, which leads to the test case not finding the element according to the original xpath and reporting an error.
By analyzing the error message, it can be concluded that there are only a few elements that cannot be interacted with, which are the "Status" dropdown box and its corresponding options.
So to fix the test case, you need to first change the xpath of the "Select Status" element in the test case, which is '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a', to '//*[@id="page_status-field"]', and then change the xpath of the following element to '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]'.
At the same time, according to the understanding of the test intent, the "Back" button in the original test case can be deleted, and no test in the new version is required for it.

The error message in the test case indicates that there is an element that cannot be interacted with, and the root cause is the removal of the "Back" button. However, there is no "Back" button in the new version of the HTML you provided.
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, we can see that the change of the major elements is not the reason for the failure of the test case.
By looking up the xpaths in the test case in the new version of the HTML you provided, I found that there is an element with an id of "page_title" and it can be interacted with. So it's likely that the element that caused the error to appear in the test case is the "Save and Close" button.
As there is no "Back" button in the new version of the HTML and the subsequent test cases could be executed, it is assumed that the root cause of the failure of the test case lies in the "Save and Close" button.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

In the new version of the HTML, the "Back" button was not found, so there was no need to fix it in the test case, and it was not found to be related to the test error.
The "Save and Close" button is assumed to be the root cause of the test error, and in order to fix it, it needs to be changed to the xpath '//*[@id="save_and_close"]' in the new version of the HTML.

2024-04-18 11:34:45,233:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Based on the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions, it seems that the "Page Content" element (xpath="//*[@id="page_content"]") is missing in the new version. This element was present in the old version but not included in the new version. 

The error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable" indicates that the test case is trying to interact with an element that is not able to receive user input, such as clicking or typing.

Possible root causes for the test case failure:
1. Missing "Page Content" element: Since the "Page Content" element is missing in the new version, any test case that interacts with this element will fail. This could be the root cause of the failure.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Element ID changes: The IDs of elements have changed between the old and new versions. Test cases that rely on specific element IDs will fail if those IDs have been modified.
2. Element location changes: The XPath of elements has changed between versions. Test cases using specific XPaths may fail if the XPaths have been updated.
3. Different functionality: The new version introduces new elements and features while removing existing ones. Test cases that rely on removed elements or expect certain functionalities may fail due to these changes.

To address the test case failure, you will need to update the test cases to reflect the changes in the new version. Specifically, any test cases interacting with the missing "Page Content" element will need to be modified or removed. Additionally, ensure that all test cases are updated to use the correct element IDs and XPaths in the new version to prevent further failures.

2024-04-18 11:35:01,198:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
The possible root cause you mentioned is that the "Page Content" element is missing. However, the element is not in the test case.
According to the error message and the analysis of the possible causes of failure you provided, we can see that the element mentioned in the error message is "s2id_page_status". By searching for it in the new version of the HTML you can see that the xpath is "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]".
It can be seen that the new version of the test case may have some problems in terms of element search and interaction.
In addition to the root cause, the new version of the HTML has no "Page Content" element at all.
So, in order to fix the test case, it is necessary to change "//*[@id="page_title"]" to "//*[@id="page_title-field"]", and change "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title-field"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

In this repaired test case, the "Page Content" element is not deleted, and the "Page Content" element is not in the new version of the HTML, so it is not affected by this change.
At the same time, the repaired test case is consistent with the error message in terms of xpath.
In addition, based on the test intent, the "Page Content" element may not be a very critical element in this test case, so it is not necessary to update the test case to test the "Page Content" element.
2024-04-18 11:35:01,198:INFO:The testcase 1-2 is generated:
By analyzing the possible reasons for the failure, it is found that the change of "Page Content" element is the root cause of the failure of this test case. However, according to the analysis of the possible test failure reasons, it can be found that the xpath of the "Page Content" element is very similar to that of the "Page Title" element, so it is likely that there is a certain association between the two elements. By checking the new version of the HTML content, it is found that the id of the "Page Content" element is indeed missing, but there is a "Page Title" element with an id, and there is a hidden "Append" button element next to it. Therefore, it can be inferred that the two elements are likely to be part of a search function related to the page content. Since the test case reported an "ElementNotInteractableException" error, it can be inferred that the test code executed a click operation on the "Page Content" element.
So, to fix the test case, you should delete the test code that includes the "Page Content" element, and change the line of code that reports the error to click the "Page Title" element to enter text instead of clicking.
The new test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
...

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
...

By understanding the intent of the test case and analyzing the error message, it can be concluded that the "element not interactable" exception is reported when executing the click operation, so you need to change the click operation to a send_keys operation. At the same time, in order to prevent the same error from happening again, we should try to avoid the situation where the send_keys operation is performed on the "Page Content" element.
The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
...

In this case, the root cause of the test failure was a change in the "Page Content" element. By understanding the intent of the test and the analysis of possible test failures, it was found that the "Page Content" element was likely to be part of a search-related function, and that the "Page Title" element was closely related to it. However, the analysis is not entirely accurate. The "Page Title" element and the "Append" button element are not relevant to the "Page Content" element.
The error message indicates that the element could not be interacted with, and the original test case reported an error at a line of code that clicked on an element.
According to the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the id of the "Page Content" element is really not there, and the new version of the HTML does not contain any other new elements that may be related to the "Page Content" element. It can be inferred that the "Page Content" element may have been removed in the new version, which is why the original test case failed to find it.
By looking up the xpath in the test case of the reported error, it was found that it could not be found in the new version of the HTML, and by analyzing the xpath, it was found that it was not possible to find a similar element in the new version of the HTML, so the test code on this line should be deleted.
At the same time, you need to change the click operation in the test case to a send_keys operation to prevent similar errors from happening again.
In addition, the test case is testing the function of creating a new page and setting its basic information, but the root cause of the test failure is the removal of the "Page Content" element, and the subsequent test code does not have any interaction with the "Page Content" element, so the subsequent test code does not need to be changed.
2024-04-18 11:35:01,199:INFO:The testcase 1-3 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, you can see that the "Page Content" element is not only missing in the new version, but it is not in the test case, so it is not relevant.
The error message is "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable", and according to the new version of HTML, it can be found that the "root" element (xpath="//*[@id="admin_password"]") has been removed, so it can be inferred that the root cause of the error is that the root element in the test case is missing in the new version, resulting in the subsequent code can not be executed.
To fix the test case and remove the error, simply remove the line of code in the test case that contains the xpath "//*[@id="admin_password"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="login"]').click()
# sleep(1)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="navigation-user"]/ul/li[5]/a').click()
#driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin_password"]').send_keys("root1234")
#driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin-login-form"]/div/div/button').click()
...
2024-04-18 11:35:01,199:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
The "Page Content" element is not present in the new version of the HTML, but it is not found in the test case or error message, so it is not the root cause of this test failure.
By looking up the error message and by understanding the intent of the test, I find that the "Page Title" element with ID "page_title" is likely to be what the test case was trying to interact with but was unable to do so.
In the new HTML, I found that there is a <label> element before the <input> element with the ID "s2id_page_status", which is inconsistent with the error message. By understanding the test intent, it can be inferred that it is the "Page Status" element that the test is trying to interact with but cannot.
By understanding the test intent, it can be inferred that the "Page Content" element and the "Save" button are not related to this test, so they do not need to be tested.
So, to fix the test case, you need to change the XPath of the "Page Title" element to "//*[@id="page_title"]" and the XPath of the "Page Status" element to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()

...
2024-04-18 11:35:01,199:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
The possible test intent analysis you provided is not entirely accurate. The root cause of the test case failure is not the "Page Content" element, but the "Page Title" element, because the error message says it is not interactable and it is the last element in the test case. However, the "Page Content" element may be a sub-element of the "Page Title" element, but in the new version of HTML you cannot find this element, so it is likely that the "Page Title" element has been changed to a rich text editor, and the corresponding test code needs to be modified.
According to the new HTML, there is no "Page Content" element in the test case, but there is a "Page Title" element with the id of "page_title", so it is more likely that the root cause of the test failure is this element.
In addition, by looking at the new HTML, it can be found that there is no "root1234" element with the id "admin_password", but there is a "Admin Password" element with the id "admin_password".
So in order to fix the test case, you need to replace the XPath "//*[@id="admin_password"]" with "//*[@id="admin_password"]" and "//*[@id="page_title"]" with "//*[@id="page_title"]".

2024-04-18 11:35:48,433:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the main element that was removed from the new version is "Page Content" (xpath="//*[@id="page_content"]"). This removal is most likely the root cause of the test case failure with the error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable."

Here are the key reasons for the test case failure:
1. **Missing Element:** The "Page Content" element is crucial for interacting with the content of the page. Its absence in the new version would cause any test case that interacts with the page content to fail with an "ElementNotInteractableException" since the element is no longer present to be interacted with.

2. **XPath Changes:** The XPath locators for elements have changed significantly between the old and new versions. If the test script is still using the old XPaths to locate elements in the new version, it will not be able to find them, resulting in failures.

3. **Functionality Changes:** The functionality of the web application seems to have been restructured in the new version. Elements like "Add New Page," "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" have been added, indicating a shift in the way pages are managed. If the test case is not updated to reflect these changes, it will fail when trying to interact with these new elements.

4. **UI Changes:** The layout and structure of the web application have been altered in the new version. Elements have been rearranged and some have been removed or added. If the test case relies on the specific positioning or presence of elements in the UI, it will fail due to these changes.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application. This includes modifying XPaths, updating interactions with new elements, handling removed elements, and adjusting the test logic to accommodate the redesigned functionality and UI.

2024-04-18 11:36:03,035:INFO:The testcase 2-1 is generated:
The "Page Content" element was not found in the new version of the HTML, and the error message in the test report was "element not interactable", so it can be inferred that the "Page Content" element might have been the root cause of the test case failure.
Based on the new HTML, it can be seen that the "Page Content" element has indeed disappeared, and in the relevant xpath of the error message, we can find a similar xpath like "//*[@id="page_content"]".
However, in the test case you provided, there is no xpath like "//*[@id="page_content"]".
So this is not related to the test case you provided.
However, according to the new version of the HTML, it can be found that there is no element with id "page_title" in it, and the "Page Title" element in the "Add New Page" section is the only element that is similar to it. So the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]" in the test case will not work.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to change the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]" in the test code to "//*[@id="page_title-field"]".

2024-04-18 11:36:03,036:INFO:The testcase 2-2 is generated:
Based on the understanding of the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be determined that the "Page Content" element is not the root cause of the error, and the error message is in no way related to any content interaction.
According to the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be concluded that the most likely reason for the test failure is the change of the element locator, which can be verified by comparing the failed test case and the new HTML.
At the same time, by analyzing the differences in the new HTML compared to the test case, it can be found that elements like "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" have been added to the new version, which is consistent with the understanding of the possible reasons for the test failure.
In addition, by searching the new version of the HTML for the xpath in the test case that reported the error, "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" was found to be a valid xpath, while "//*[@id="page_title"]" was not, so the latter was the xpath that reported the error.
In the new version of the HTML, the xpath is different from the test case, and the id is "page_title-field", while in the test case it is "//*[@id="page_title"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title-field"]').send_keys("123")
...

The repaired test case you provided has an xpath "//*[@id="page_title-field"]" that does not exist in the new version of the HTML, which I believe is a typo and should be "//*[@id="page_title"]".
In addition, according to the error message, the element corresponding to the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]" could not be interacted with, so the element in the new version of the HTML should be "not interactable", not just "not found".
At the same time, the "root1234" in the test case is a constant string, so it is not possible to determine whether it meets the format requirements or not based on the analysis of the error message and the test case, and no new information on test input format requirements is provided.

The repaired test case is:

2024-04-18 11:36:03,036:INFO:The testcase 2-3 is generated:
Based on the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure, it can be inferred that the "Page Content" element was removed, which is not the root cause, but it is related to the line of code that caused the error.
At the same time, the error message contains "ElementNotInteractable", which means that it is an operation element that caused the error.
By comparing the new HTML with the test code, you can find that there is no "Page Content" element at all, and there is no element in the new version that has the same semantic meaning.
Based on this, we can analyze that the "Page Content" element is unlikely to be the root cause of the test failure.
However, there is a new "Page ID" element in the new version of the HTML that appears to be in a similar position to the "Page Content" element in the test case.
By looking at the test intent and understanding the test case, it can be inferred that this test case tries to edit a specific page, but it cannot find the target page, so it reports an error.
So, to fix the test case, you need to find the corresponding test code line and change the xpath of the "Page Content" element to the xpath of the "Page ID" element.
In addition, to prevent similar test errors, the xpath in the error message needs to be updated in the test case.
The root cause of the error in this test case is most likely that the test is trying to edit a non-existent page, but the error is triggered by the operation of an element that cannot be interacted with.

The repaired test case is:

Based on the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure, it can be concluded that "Page Content" was removed from the new version of the page, and the error message is "element not interactable", which means that the new page may have become a read-only page, so it is likely that the error is caused by a change in the functionality of the test page.
The possible reasons for test failure also mentioned that there have been changes in the functionality of adding new pages, publishing, unpublishing, deleting, and other functions, so we need to look at the new version of the HTML to see if there is any correlation with the reported error in the new version of the HTML.
To fully understand the possible reasons for the failure of the test, we need to find out the "Page Content" element in the old version of the HTML to see how it is related to the failed test case.
From the new HTML we can see that there is no "Page Content" element, so the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure is based on a misunderstanding.
At the same time, by understanding the reported error message and finding the xpath in the new version of the HTML, we can find that it is consistent with the xpath in the test case, so the root cause of the "element not interactable" error in the test case is that the element with id "page_content" does not exist, but not that the "Page Content" element was removed.
In addition, by looking at the new HTML, we can see that there is indeed a "Page Content" element in the reported error test code, but it is a label element and it has no interactive properties, which means that the test will not interact with this element.
At the same time, there is no "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" functionality in the new HTML that is likely to be reported as an error in the reported test code.
So, the possible cause of test failure you mentioned is wrong.
Based on the information you provided, you cannot tell why the test failed.
In order to find out why the test failed, you need to first understand the intent of the test and the relationship between the various elements mentioned in the possible reasons for the test failure.
Then, by looking at the new version of the HTML, you can determine which of the "Page Content" elements and "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete" elements are still there, and how they are related to the intent of the test.
Only by understanding this, can we be able to correctly understand the possible reasons for the test failure and be able to accurately determine how to fix the test case.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

In this repaired test case, the reported "element not interactable" error is likely to be "//*[@id="page_status"]", "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]", or "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]", "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" one of the elements.
But this test case can still fail with a "element not interactable" error because there are still some hidden or read-only elements in the line of code that cannot be interacted with.
So to fix the test case, you need to further analyze the functionality of the new version of the web page, in order to identify hidden or read-only elements and then delete the corresponding lines of test code.
2024-04-18 11:36:03,036:INFO:The testcase 2-5 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, we can see that the "Page Content" element is not as relevant to the error message as the "Page Title" and "Status" elements.
By understanding the new HTML of the new version, you can see that the "Page Content" is still there, but it is not in the form of a <form>, which is not a major change.
At the same time, I also found that the "Page Content" element is not mentioned in the test case.
According to the test intent, the elements "Page Title" and "Status" that are more relevant to the error message are intended to be tested, but they are not found in the test case, so this test case is already wrong.

The original test case is to edit a page, so the "Content" of the page should be edited as well. According to the new HTML, I found that there is an element with id "page_content" in the test intent, and I also found that there is a similar element in the new HTML, so it should not be deleted.
The error message shows that the element with id "page_title" cannot be interacted with, so according to the error message and the new HTML, I found a similar element with id "page_status", so I can infer that the root cause of the error is that the "Page Title" element and the "Status" element cannot be interacted with.
In the new HTML, I did not find an element with the id "save_and_close", but I found a "Save" button, which has a similar meaning.
So I can infer that in order to ensure that the subsequent test cases can be executed normally, you need to change the test case line that contains "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" to "//*[@id="tab-content-cpa"]/form[2]/button[1]".

The repaired test case is:

driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_name"])[2]').send_keys("admin")

2024-04-18 11:37:03,934:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old version and the new version, we can see that the "Page Content" element (xpath="//*[@id="page_content"]") from the old version is missing in the new version. This missing element is the first element removed, which is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Here are the main reasons for the test case failure:

1. Missing Element: The "Page Content" element was a crucial element in the old version for entering and editing the content of a page. Its absence in the new version would cause the test case to fail when trying to interact with this element, resulting in the "ElementNotInteractableException" error.

2. Element Structure Changes: The structure and layout of the elements have been significantly modified in the new version. The elements related to page actions, visibility, categories, and language have been reorganized or renamed, which could lead to issues in locating and interacting with these elements during testing.

3. XPath Changes: The xpaths of the elements have also been updated in the new version. If the test automation scripts are hardcoded with xpaths from the old version, they would no longer be valid in the new version, causing failures in element identification and interaction.

4. Functional Changes: The functionalities related to page management seem to have been revamped in the new version with the addition of new elements like checkboxes for "test," buttons for publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages, and search options. These changes might require updates in the test scripts to accommodate the new features and interactions.

To address the test case failure, the test automation scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. Specifically, the script should be modified to handle the absence of the "Page Content" element and adjust for the structural and xpath changes in the elements. Additionally, any new functionalities introduced in the new version should be incorporated into the test scripts for comprehensive testing coverage.

2024-04-18 11:37:19,116:INFO:The testcase 3-1 is generated:
The xpath in the test case that is also mentioned in the error message is not found in the new version of the HTML you provided, so the test case could not have failed because of it.
In understanding the possible reasons for the failure, it can be determined that the root cause of the failure is that the test case reports an ElementNotInteractableException when it sends a value to the "Page Content" element, but the xpath for the error message does not appear in the new version of the HTML, indicating that there is no such element in the new version of the HTML.
Understanding the test intent, the test case failed when trying to interact with the "Page Content" element, and the first line of the error message contains the word "interactable", so it can be inferred that the test case failed due to the inability to interact with the "Page Content" element.
By understanding the possible reasons for the failure, it is known that the "Page Content" element has been removed in the new version, and the subsequent test steps are likely to fail as well.
So to fix the test case, just delete or comment out the line that contains the xpath of the "Page Content" element.
At the same time, the new test intent shows that the test case is used to test the "Page Title" element, "Page Status" element, and the "save and close" button, but there are no test steps in the test case that correspond to the test of the "Page Title" and "Page Status" elements. So these elements need to be tested in the new test.
Based on the understanding of the possible causes of test failure, it can be inferred that the test case may also fail for the elements "Actions", "Page ID" and "Page Title" that are in the same table row as the "Page Content" element.

According to the possible reasons for the test failure you provided, the "Page Content" element was not found in the new version of the HTML, and there was a "Page Content" element in the error message, so there is a high possibility that this element is consistent with the "Page Content" element in the new version.
By understanding the test intent, it can be inferred that the change in the "Page Content" element is unlikely to have a direct impact on this test case because the test case does not contain any operations related to the "Page Content" element. The first root cause of failure in the possible reasons you gave is that the "Page Content" element is not in the new HTML, and the second root cause of failure is that the structure of the elements has changed significantly, which leads to the conclusion that the elements related to the page actions, visibility, categories, and language may have been modified.
By searching for the id in the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the "Page Status", "Page Visibility", and "Page Category" elements are unchanged, while the xpath in the test case is consistent with the error message, so it is likely that the element that cannot be interacted with is the "Page Language" element.
By analyzing the error message and the new HTML, it can be found that the root cause of the test failure is that the element with id "page_language" in the new HTML could not be interacted with.
So to fix the test case just change the xpath "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" to "//*[@id="s2id_page_language"]/a", and change "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]" to "//*[@id="select2-results-4"]/li[2]".

According to the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure, the test cases include the "Page Content" element, but the error message reported is an "ElementNotInteractableException" error, which means that the element cannot be interacted with, rather than not found. Therefore, the removal of the "Page Content" element is not a direct cause of the test failure.
By analyzing the error message, it can be found that the failed xpath expression in the test case is mentioned in the error message, and the reported error is "element not interactable", so it can be inferred that the root cause of the test failure is probably because some elements cannot be interacted with, such as hidden or blocked by other elements.
At the same time, by comparing the new version of the HTML and the test case, it can be found that the xpath of the "Page Content" element is "// *[@id="page_content"]", but this test case has no operation on this element, so there is no direct relationship with this error.
So the root cause of the test failure is that some elements cannot be interacted with, and this is likely to be due to changes in the new version of the application that affect the visibility or state of the elements, which can be confirmed by understanding that the "Page Content" element has been removed in the new version.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to remove the line of code in the test case that interacts with the "Page Content" element, and move the xpath of the subsequent test steps up by one line.
The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()

2024-04-18 11:37:19,117:INFO:The testcase 3-4 is generated:
According to the possible reasons for the failure you provided, the root cause of the failure of the test case is that the "Page Content" element is missing, resulting in the subsequent test case being unable to be executed and an ElementNotInteractableException being thrown.
However, by looking up the xpath mentioned in the error message and the xpath of the subsequent test case in the new version of the HTML, we can find that the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]" can still be found in the new version of the HTML, which means that the "Page Content" element is not the root cause of the test case failure.
In the new version of HTML, it can be found that there is a "Page Content" element, with xpath="//*[@id="page_content"]".
In addition, by analyzing the error message and the test case, it can be found that the error occurs before the "Page Title" test step in the test case, and the root cause of the error may be the element with xpath "//*[@id="admin_password"]".
According to the new version of the HTML, we can find that there is no such element with an id of "admin_password", but there is a very similar one with an id of "admin_password_reset".
So, in order to fix this test case, you need to change the xpath in the test case to "//*[@id="admin_password_reset"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin_password_reset"]').send_keys("root1234")

2024-04-18 11:37:19,117:INFO:The testcase 3-5 is generated:
The error message mentions that the element cannot be interacted with, but the xpath of the element is not in the test case, so it has no effect on the test case.
By analyzing the possible reasons for the failure, it can be found that the "Page Content" element is not related to the test case. This can be confirmed by checking the xpath in the error message.
Looking at the new version of the HTML, you can see that the "Page Content" element can still be found, and it is located in the "tab-content-cpa" element in the new version of the HTML, which is more consistent with the test intent.
In order to fix the error and align with the test intent, you need to add a line of code to the test case to click on the "Edit" button in the "Actions" column of the table.
The "Page Status" and "Page Content" elements are also mentioned in the possible reasons for the failure, but they cannot be found in the xpath in the error message, and the test cases do not interact with them in the original version, so they are not related to the test failure.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/section[2]/div/div/div/form/div/table/tbody/tr/td[6]/a[2]').click()
