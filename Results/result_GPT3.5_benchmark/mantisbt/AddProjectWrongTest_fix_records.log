2024-10-29 23:05:57,721:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the structure of the elements has changed significantly. The key change that stands out is the removal of the element "//*[@id="content"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr[5]/td/table/tbody/tr/td[1]" in the old version, which corresponds to the "new" element.

The root cause of the test case failure is likely due to this missing "new" element in the new version. The error message provided indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with the xpath "//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']", which is not found in either the old or new version's major elements. This suggests that the test case logic may be outdated or incorrect, leading to the failure to locate the expected element.

Other potential reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the HTML structure or layout of the web application affecting the element locators specified in the test cases.
2. Changes in the underlying code or functionality of the web application impacting the behavior of elements.
3. Incorrect or outdated test case design that does not align with the updated version of the web application.

To address this test case failure, the test case logic needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the major elements of the new version. Specifically, the xpath selector for locating the "new" element should be revised based on the new xpath provided for the element in the new version. Additionally, the test case should be reviewed to ensure it accurately reflects the current state and functionality of the web application.

2024-10-29 23:06:23,757:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the structure of the elements has changed. The key difference that stands out is the removal of the "//*[@id="content"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr[5]/td" element in the new version.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The error message indicates that the element "//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']" could not be located. Since the first element that was removed in the new version is "//*[@id="content"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr[5]/td" which is related to user management, it is likely that the removal of this element caused the test case to fail when trying to locate the element related to managing users.

Other Possible Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in XPath: The XPath for elements in the new version has been updated, and if the test cases are using the old XPaths from the previous version, they will fail to locate the elements in the new version.
2. Changes in Page Structure: The overall structure of the page seems to have been modified, which could affect the way elements are located and interacted with in the new version.
3. Missing or Renamed Elements: Apart from the removed element, there could be other elements that have been renamed or removed, causing the test cases to fail when trying to locate them.

To address the test case failures, the test scripts need to be updated with the new XPaths and any other necessary changes to adapt to the modifications in the page structure. Additionally, it's essential to review and update the test cases to align with the changes in the application's elements and functionality.

2024-10-29 23:06:40,600:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the main element that changed is the xpath for "Reported by Me":

Old version:
- "Reported by Me" xpath="//*[@id="content"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td/a"

New version:
- "Reported by Me" xpath="//*[@id="main_div"]/div/table[1]/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/a"

Based on the error message provided:
- org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']"}

The error message indicates that the element "//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']" could not be located. This element is not present in the list of major elements for both the old and new versions provided.

The root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the change in the xpath for "Reported by Me" element. The xpath in the new version is different from the xpath in the old version. Since the error message is related to an element not being located, it is possible that the test case is trying to interact with the "Reported by Me" element using the old xpath which is no longer valid in the new version.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpath for the "Reported by Me" element in the new version of the web application. Additionally, if the "//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']" element is required for the test case, its xpath needs to be identified and updated in the test script as well.

In summary, the test case failed due to the xpath change for the "Reported by Me" element and the absence of the "//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']" element in the major elements of both versions.

2024-10-29 23:07:31,247:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the key change that stands out is the removal of the element "//*[@id="content"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr[5]/td/table/tbody/tr/td[1]" from the old version to the new version.

The error message indicates that the test case is failing due to a NoSuchElementException when trying to locate the element with the xpath "//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']". This error is likely occurring because the test case is trying to interact with an element that is no longer present in the new version of the web application.

The root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the element "new" from the page structure in the new version. This removal has likely caused the subsequent elements in the table structure to shift, leading to the failure of the test case when trying to interact with the element "//a[@href='manage_user_page.php']".

To resolve this issue and update the test case to work with the new version, the test script needs to be updated to interact with the corresponding element in the new version's page structure. The xpath for the element "new" in the new version is "//*[@id="main_div"]/div/table[2]/tbody/tr/td/table/tbody/tr/td[1]". By updating the test script to use this new xpath, the test case should be able to locate and interact with the element successfully in the new version of the web application.

Test Intent: The test case "AddProjectWrongTest" seems to be testing the functionality of adding a new project on a web application. The test case first sets up the environment by logging in as an administrator. Then, it navigates to the project management section and tries to create a new project with the name "Project001 New". 

The specific intent of this test case operation is to validate the behavior when trying to add a project with a name that already exists in the system. The test is expecting to find an error message indicating that a project with the same name already exists, and it verifies this message using an assertion.

Overall, the test case is designed to confirm that the system correctly handles the scenario of attempting to add a project with a duplicate name and displays the appropriate error message to the user.

2024-10-29 23:11:41,888:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. In the old version, there was an element "Prune Accounts" with the xpath "//*[@id="main_div"]/table[1]/tbody/tr[1]/td/form/input", which is missing in the new version.
2. In the new version, there are new elements such as "Main", "My View", "View Issues", "Report Issue", etc., which were not present in the old version.

Given that the error message specifically mentions the element "//a[@href='manage_proj_page.php']", which is not present in either the old or new version's major elements list, it is likely that this element was added in the new version and is causing the test case failure.

Root cause and other reasons for the test case failure:
1. **Element Removal:** The removal of the "Prune Accounts" element from the old version to the new version is the most likely root cause of the test case failure.
2. **New Elements:** The addition of new elements in the new version can also cause the test case to fail if it is not properly handled in the test script.
3. **XPath Changes:** If there were any changes in the XPath of existing elements between the old and new versions, it could also lead to test case failure.
4. **Page Structure Changes:** Any changes in the overall page structure or layout between the old and new versions could impact the identification of elements and result in test failures.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version, including identifying new elements and handling the removal of old elements. Additionally, verifying and updating the XPaths of existing elements in the test script is necessary to ensure accurate element identification.

2024-10-29 23:12:09,549:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Prune Accounts" has been removed in the new version. This removal of the "Prune Accounts" element is most likely the root cause of the test case failure. 

The error message indicates that the test is looking for an element with the xpath "//a[@href='manage_proj_page.php']", but it is unable to locate it. This suggests that the test case is trying to interact with the "Prune Accounts" element which no longer exists in the new version, leading to the NoSuchElementException error.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the web page: The new version may have reorganized the elements on the page, leading to xpath changes and the inability to locate certain elements.
2. Renaming of elements: The names or identifiers of the elements may have been changed in the new version, causing the test case to fail when trying to interact with them.
3. Changes in functionality: The functionality related to the "Prune Accounts" element may have been removed or replaced in the new version, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the test case failure, you will need to update the test case to reflect the changes in the new version. Specifically, you should remove references to the "Prune Accounts" element and update the xpath selectors to match the new elements in the new version.
