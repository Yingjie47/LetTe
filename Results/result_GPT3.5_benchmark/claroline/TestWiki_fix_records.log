2024-10-29 00:03:29,199:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Search from keyword" element is missing in the new version. However, based on the error message provided, the test case failure is not related to this missing element.

The error message states that the test is unable to locate an element with the CSS selector "button[type="submit"]". This indicates that the "Enter" button element has been changed in the new version from a button element to an input element.

The root cause of the test case failure is the change in the "Enter" button element from a button to an input in the new version. As a result, the test script is unable to locate the element using the CSS selector "button[type="submit"]".

To fix the test case, you need to update the CSS selector in the test script to reflect the new element type. The updated CSS selector should be "input[type="submit"]" to locate the "Enter" input element in the new version.

In summary, the test case failed because of a change in the element type of the "Enter" button from a button to an input in the new version, causing the test script to be unable to locate the element using the old CSS selector.
