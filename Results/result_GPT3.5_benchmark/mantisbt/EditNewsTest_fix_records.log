Explanation:
In the new version of the HTML, the `<img>` element is nested within an `<a>` tag, but the `<img>` element does not have any attributes such as `src`, `alt`, or `border` set. Additionally, the `<a>` tag does not have a `title` attribute.

Therefore, while you can still locate the `<img>` element within the `<a>` tag using XPath, the operation of displaying an image as a clickable link with specific attributes like `src`, `alt`, and `border` cannot be reproduced exactly in the new version as those attributes are not present.

New XPath Expression: //div[@align='left']/a/img

This XPath expression will locate the `<img>` element within the `<a>` tag that is nested within a `<div>` element with `align` attribute set to "left". However, since the `<img>` element does not have specific attributes set in the new version, the operation of displaying the image as a clickable link with specific attributes cannot be replicated exactly.
