2024-10-28 22:11:58,245:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the following changes are apparent:

1. "Username" xpath="//*[@id="login"]" vs. "User name" xpath="//*[@id="login"]"
2. "Enter" xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button" vs. "Enter" xpath="//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]"
3. "Search from keyword" xpath="//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]" is removed
4. "Search" xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button" is removed
5. "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a" is added

Based on the error message provided: "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}", it is evident that the test case is failing due to the inability to locate the "button" element with the attribute "type" set to "submit".

The main reasons for the test case failure are:

1. The "button" element with "type" set to "submit" has been removed from the new version of the application, causing the test case to fail as it cannot locate this element.
2. Changes in the structure of the login form have led to a mismatch in the XPath used to locate the "Enter" button, resulting in the test case failure.
3. The removal of the "Search" and "Search from keyword" elements might have impacted test cases related to searching functionality, although this is not directly related to the provided error message.
4. The addition of the "CS212 - Computer Science" element does not seem to be directly related to the provided error message, but it indicates additional changes in the application that might affect other test cases.

In summary, the primary reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "button" element with "type" set to "submit" in the new version of the application, causing the test case to be unable to locate this element and resulting in a "NoSuchElementException". Additionally, changes in the structure of the login form have also contributed to the failure of the test case.
