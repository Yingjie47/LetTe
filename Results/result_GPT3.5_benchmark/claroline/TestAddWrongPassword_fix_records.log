Test Intent: 
This test case, named TestAddWrongPassword, aims to verify the behavior of a web application feature related to creating a user account with a wrong password confirmation. The test scenario involves filling out a user creation form with details such as last name, first name, official code, username, password, and password confirmation. The key operation being tested is when the user enters two different passwords in the "password" and "confirm password" fields. The test expects the system to display an error message "You typed two different passwords" to inform the user about the mismatch. 

Therefore, the primary intent of this test case is to validate the functionality that ensures the system correctly detects and handles the scenario where the user provides different passwords during the account creation process.

2024-10-28 21:39:39,600:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
The main elements that have changed between the old and new versions are related to the login functionality. In the old version, the "Enter" button was located using the xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button", while in the new version, it is located using the xpath "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]".

Based on the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}", it appears that the test case is trying to locate a button element using a CSS selector with the attribute "type" set to "submit", which does not exist in either the old or new version of the application.

The root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the "Enter" button element from the new version. Since the test case is trying to interact with a button element that no longer exists, it is unable to locate the element, leading to the "NoSuchElementException" error.

To resolve this issue, the test case needs to be updated to interact with the new "Enter" button element using the correct xpath "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]" in the new version of the application. Additionally, the CSS selector used in the test case should be updated to target the correct button element based on the changes made in the new version.

In summary, the test case failed due to the removal of the "Enter" button element in the new version of the application, leading to an error when trying to locate the element using the outdated CSS selector.

Test Intent: 
The test case "TestAddWrongPassword.java" is testing the scenario where a user tries to create a new user in a web application's platform administration section with a wrong password confirmation. The test ensures that the system correctly detects and handles the case where the entered password and password confirmation do not match.

The test case performs the following operations:
1. Navigates to the login page and logs in as an administrator.
2. Goes to the platform administration section and initiates the user creation process.
3. Enters user details such as last name, first name, official code, username, and password.
4. Enters a password in the "password" field and a different password in the "password confirmation" field.
5. Selects the user role as a student.
6. Attempts to create the user by clicking the "Apply Change" button.
7. Asserts that the system correctly displays the error message "You typed two different passwords" due to the mismatch in password and password confirmation fields.

Overall, the test case verifies the functionality of password validation during user creation to ensure data integrity and security in the web application.

2024-10-28 21:43:29,454:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Username" element in the old version has been changed to "User name" in the new version. This change in element naming is likely the root cause of the test case failure as indicated by the error message "no such element: Unable to locate element."

The error message specifically mentions not being able to locate an element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[1]". This indicates that the test case is trying to interact with an element that is not present in the new version of the web application. 

The discrepancy in the naming convention of the "Username" element between the old and new versions is likely causing the test case to fail as it is looking for an element with the old xpath which no longer exists in the new version. To fix the test case, the xpath reference for the "User name" element should be updated to match the new version's xpath.

In addition to the root cause mentioned above, other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the structure of the page that may have affected the xpath of other elements, changes in the timing of element loading causing elements to be temporarily unavailable, or changes in the behavior of the web application that were not accounted for in the test case.
