Explanation:
In the new version of the HTML provided, there is no `<div>` element with the attribute `align="left"`. The closest element to the original `<div align="left">` is the `<div align="center">`, but it does not serve the same purpose or contain the same content as the original `<div>` element.

Therefore, the operation of aligning content to the left side of the page using a `<div>` element with `align="left"` cannot be reproduced exactly in the new version of the HTML.

Explanation:
In the new version of the HTML, there is no `<div>` element with the class name "center" and align attribute set to "center" that serves as a container for bug tracking options and functionalities. The closest element to the description provided is the `<div align="center">`, but it does not have the same class name or the same purpose as the original `<div>` element.

Therefore, the operation cannot be reproduced exactly in the new version as the required element structure and attributes are not present.
