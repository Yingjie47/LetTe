**Test Case Operation Intent:**

The test case TestAddDeniedCourse.java is setting up a WebDriver for Chrome and navigating to a specified base URL. The test method testAddDeniedCourse is then attempting to create a new course site by filling out various form fields on the page, such as course title, official code, category, titular, etc. Finally, the test asserts that after creating the course website, a success message with the course number "225" is displayed on the page.

**Test Intent:**

The test intent of this test case is to verify the functionality of adding a new course site on the web application. The test is specifically checking whether the system correctly handles the creation of a course site with the official code "225" and displays the success message confirming the creation of the course website with the correct course number.

2024-10-28 11:36:29,297:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparison of main elements between old and new versions:
1. "Username" - changed from "//*[@id="login"]" to "//*[@id="login"]"
2. "Enter" - changed from "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button" to "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]"

Root cause of test case failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is the change in the "Enter" button's XPath from the old version to the new version. In the old version, the XPath for the "Enter" button was "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button", but in the new version, it changed to "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]". This change in the XPath caused the test case to fail as the automation script was unable to locate the new "Enter" button based on the old XPath.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Inconsistent element naming: The change from "Username" to "User name" might have caused confusion in the automation script if it was not updated to reflect this change.
2. Missing element: The error message indicates that the automation script was looking for a button with the type "submit", which was not present in the new version. This suggests that the "Enter" button might have been changed to an input field without the "submit" type, causing the script to fail.
3. Structural changes: The change in the structure of the login form (moving the "Enter" button inside the form) could have also impacted the automation script's ability to locate and interact with the button.

To address the test case failure, the automation script needs to be updated with the new XPath for the "Enter" button and any other relevant changes in element naming or structure in the new version of the web application.

Test Intent: 
The test case "TestAddDeniedCourse.java" is testing the functionality of adding a denied course on a web application, likely an e-learning platform (based on the references to course creation and administration). The test aims to simulate the scenario where a course creation request is denied or fails for some reason.

The test case sets up the WebDriver, logs in as an admin user, navigates to the course creation page, fills in course details such as title and code, selects a category, enters additional information, and attempts to create the course. The test then asserts that the correct message is displayed confirming the failure to create the course.

Overall, the test case is intended to verify that the system handles the creation of denied courses correctly and displays the appropriate feedback message to the user.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that there have been significant changes in the xpath expressions used to locate the elements. The main changes are:

1. "My desktop" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[1]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[1]"

2. "My messages" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[2]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[3]"

3. "Platform administration" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[3]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[4]"

4. "Manage my account" xpath (removed in new version)

5. "Logout" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a"

6. "Continue" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a"

Based on the error message provided:
- The error mentions that it is unable to locate the element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div". This xpath is not present in either the old or new version's major elements list, indicating a new element has been added or modified in the new version that the test case is trying to interact with but is not found.

The root cause of the test case failure is likely due to the removal of the "Manage my account" element in the new version, which causes the test case to fail when trying to interact with this element. Additionally, the error message points to a different xpath ("//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div") that is not part of the major elements in either version, suggesting a new element has been added or modified in the new version that the test case is not handling correctly.

In summary, the test case failed due to the removal of the "Manage my account" element and potential changes in other elements' xpaths in the new version, causing the test case to not locate the expected elements during execution.
