2024-10-28 21:27:47,084:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Search from keyword" element with xpath "//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]" from the old version is missing in the new version. However, this element is not related to the error message provided.

Looking at the error message, it states that the test case failed due to a NoSuchElementException for the element with the selector "button[type="submit"]". In both the old and new versions, there is no element with the selector "button[type="submit"]" listed among the major elements. This indicates that there might have been a change in the implementation of the login form or button element in the new version that is causing the test case to fail.

Analyzing further, we can see that in the old version, the "Enter" button was located using the xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button", whereas in the new version, the "Enter" button is located using the xpath "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]". This change in the xpath for the "Enter" button element could be the root cause of the failure.

The error message indicates that the test script is trying to locate a button element with the selector "button[type="submit"]", which does not exist in the current version. This suggests that the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version, such as locating the "Enter" button using the correct xpath.

In summary, the root cause of the test case failure is the change in the xpath for the "Enter" button element between the old and new versions, leading to the test script not being able to locate the button element with the expected selector. The test script needs to be updated to use the correct xpath for locating the "Enter" button in the new version to resolve the failure.

**Test Case Intent:**
The test case `TestAddWrongEmail.java` is testing the functionality of adding a new user to a platform administration system, specifically focusing on the validation of the email input field. 

1. **Test Objective:**
   - To verify that when attempting to create a new user with an invalid email address format, the system correctly identifies the error and displays the appropriate error message.

2. **Test Steps:**
   - The test case first navigates to the platform administration section and then proceeds to create a new user by filling in various user details such as name, username, password, and email.
   - The test intentionally provides an incorrect email format (just the word "email" instead of a valid email address) to trigger the validation check.
   - After submitting the form, the test verifies that the system displays the expected error message stating "The email address is not valid".

3. **Expected Outcome:**
   - The test expects the system to detect the invalid email format and display the corresponding error message, indicating that the email address provided is not in a valid format.

4. **Element Focus:**
   - The primary element under test is the "Email" field (identified by xpath `//*[@id="email"]`) where the test deliberately inputs an incorrect email address to evaluate the system's validation behavior.

5. **Additional Notes:**
   - The test case could be enhanced by including positive test scenarios with valid email addresses to ensure the system accepts valid inputs as expected.

In summary, the test case aims to validate the system's ability to identify and handle incorrect email formats during the user creation process in the platform administration system.

2024-10-28 21:30:28,329:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Based on the major elements of the old and new versions provided, the main difference between the two versions is the change in the label for the "Username" field:

Old Version:
4. "Username" xpath="//*[@id="username"]"

New Version:
4. "User name" xpath="//*[@id="username"]"

The error message indicates that the test case failed due to an element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[1]" not being found, which is not related to the "Username" field. However, the change in the label for the "Username" field may have caused a potential issue in the test case if the test script was referencing the old label "Username" instead of "User name".

Root Cause:
The root cause of the test case failure is likely due to the change in the label for the "Username" field from "Username" to "User name" in the new version. If the test script was searching for the "Username" field using the old label, it would fail to locate the element, resulting in a NoSuchElementException.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Incorrect XPath: The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with a specific XPath, which may have changed in the new version, causing the test case to fail.

2. Timing Issue: The test case failure could also be caused by a timing issue where the element was not fully loaded or rendered on the page when the test script attempted to interact with it.

3. Environment Configuration: Changes in the environment configuration or setup could also lead to test case failures, such as changes in browser versions, driver versions, or other dependencies.

To address the test case failure, update the test script to reference the new label "User name" for the "Username" field. Additionally, ensure that the XPath selectors used in the test script are updated to match the elements in the new version of the web application. Conduct further investigation to determine if there are any other changes in the application that could have impacted the test case execution.
