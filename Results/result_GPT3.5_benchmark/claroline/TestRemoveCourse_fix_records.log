2024-10-28 22:54:36,853:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the main change is in the "Enter" button element:

Old Version:
3. "Enter" xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/fieldset/button"

New Version:
3. "Enter" xpath="//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]"

The error message states: org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}

The root cause of the test case failure is likely the change in the "Enter" button element's xpath in the new version. The xpath of the button in the old version was different from the xpath of the button in the new version. The test case is trying to locate a button using a CSS selector with the attribute "type" set to "submit", which doesn't exist in either the old or new versions.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the login form: The form structure may have been modified in the new version, leading to elements being located differently or not being present at all.
2. Changes in the way elements are referenced: The way elements are referenced in the new version may have changed, leading to the test case not being able to locate the elements correctly.
3. Changes in the functionality: The functionality associated with the "Enter" button may have been modified in the new version, causing the test case to fail when interacting with it.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the correct xpath for the "Enter" button in the new version. Additionally, ensure that any other changes in the application structure or element referencing are accounted for in the test script.

Main elements changes between the old and new versions:
1. "Manage my account" element is removed in the new version.
2. "Claroline" element is added in the new version.
3. The xpath of the "Continue" element is changed in the new version.
4. The structure of the "My desktop", "My messages", "Platform administration", and "Logout" elements are changed in the new version.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. **Root Cause**: The xpath of the "Continue" element in the new version has changed, causing the test case to fail as the element cannot be located using the old xpath.
   
2. **Other Reasons**:
   - The removal of the "Manage my account" element in the new version might have impacted the test flow, leading to a failure if the test case was dependent on this element.
   - The structural changes in the "My desktop", "My messages", "Platform administration", and "Logout" elements may have caused the test case to fail if the test script was interacting with these elements based on the old structure.
   - The addition of the "Claroline" element might have affected the layout or functionality of the page, potentially causing the test case to fail if it was not accounted for in the test script.

Recommendation:
- Update the test script with the new xpaths and adjust the interactions with elements based on the updated structure in the new version to ensure the test cases pass successfully.
- Review the test case dependencies and update them accordingly to accommodate the changes in the application's elements and structure.

6. "Logout" xpath="//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a" (Old) vs "Logout" xpath="//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a" (New)

Based on the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div"}

The key change that likely caused the test case failure is the removal of the "div" element within "claroBody" in the new version. This change directly impacted the element located at "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div", which is now missing in the new version.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the hierarchy of elements in the new version, leading to XPath mismatches.
- Changes in the attribute values or structure of elements, causing locators to fail.
- Renaming or repositioning of elements, making them inaccessible through the previous locators.

To address the test case failure, update the XPath locator for the element that previously pointed to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" in the old version to match the new structure or remove this step if it is no longer relevant in the updated version. Additionally, review and adjust other locators affected by the changes in the new version to ensure the test cases run successfully.

Comparing the main elements of the two versions, we can see the following changes:

1. In the old version, there was an element "Manage my account" with xpath "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[2]/span/a" which is missing in the new version.
2. In the new version, the xpath for "Continue" element has changed from "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a" to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a".
3. The structure of the elements under "userBannerLeft" has changed in the new version. The specific changes are:
   - "My desktop" xpath has changed from "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[1]/span/a" to "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[1]".
   - "My messages" xpath has changed from "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[2]/span/a" to "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[3]".
   - "Platform administration" xpath has changed from "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[3]/span/a" to "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[4]".

Based on the error message provided, "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div"}", it seems that the main reason for the test case failure is the removal of the element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" in the new version. This change in the structure of the elements has led to the test case looking for an element that no longer exists, causing the NoSuchElementException error.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the xpaths of elements leading to incorrect element identification.
- Changes in the hierarchy or structure of elements causing the test case to navigate to the wrong elements.
- Changes in element attributes or properties affecting the interaction with elements.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the correct xpaths and element structure based on the new version of the web application. This will ensure that the test case can locate and interact with the elements accurately, preventing NoSuchElementException errors and ensuring the successful execution of the test case.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. "Manage my account" element from the old version is missing in the new version.
2. "Platform administration" element has been repositioned to a different index in the new version.
3. "My User Account" element has been added in the new version.
4. "My desktop", "My messages", and "Logout" elements have been restructured with different XPaths in the new version.
5. The "Continue" element has been modified with a different XPath in the new version.

Analyzing the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div"}

The error indicates that the test case failed because the element located at the XPath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" in the new version could not be found.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. **Root Cause**: The main reason for the test case failure is the missing element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" in the new version. This element seems to be critical for the test case, and its absence led to the NoSuchElementException.

2. **Element Restructuring**: The restructuring of elements such as "My desktop", "My messages", and "Logout" with different XPaths in the new version could have also contributed to the failure if the test case was interacting with these elements.

3. **Element Repositioning**: The repositioning of the "Platform administration" element to a different index in the new version might have affected the test case if it relied on the specific order of elements.

4. **New Element**: The addition of the "My User Account" element in the new version might have introduced changes in the flow or functionality that impacted the test case.

5. **Modified Element**: The modification of the "Continue" element with a different XPath in the new version could have caused the test case to fail if it was interacting with this element.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the elements' structure, positions, and XPaths in the new version of the web application. Specifically, the missing element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" needs to be reviewed to determine if it is a critical element for the test case and update the test script accordingly.

Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:

1. "Manage my account" from the old version is replaced by "My User Account" in the new version.
2. The xpath for "Continue" element has been changed from "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a" in the old version to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a" in the new version.
3. The xpath for "My desktop", "My messages", "Platform administration", and "Logout" elements have been updated with different paths in the new version.
4. In the old version, there was an element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a", which is no longer present in the new version.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:

1. Root cause: The main element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a" present in the old version is not found in the new version. This missing element is most likely the root cause of the test case failure as it is referenced in the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div"}".

2. Other reasons:
   - Changes in the xpaths of elements such as "My desktop", "My messages", "Platform administration", and "Logout" could also lead to failures if the test cases are looking for these elements using the old xpaths.
   - The structure of the elements in the user banner has changed in the new version, such as "My User Account" replacing "Manage my account" and the ordering of elements under "userBannerLeft" being rearranged.
   - The change in the xpath for the "Continue" element can cause failures if the test case is searching for it using the old xpath.

To address the test case failures, the test scripts need to be updated with the new xpaths and element names based on the changes in the new version of the web application. Additionally, any references to the missing element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a" should be removed or updated in the test scripts.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. In the old version, the xpath for "Continue" was "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a", while in the new version, it changed to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a".
2. The old version had "Manage my account" as a major element, which was removed in the new version.
3. The xpath for "My desktop", "My messages", "Platform administration", and "Logout" elements were modified in the new version.

Based on the error message provided, the primary reason for the test case failure is the change in the xpath for the "Continue" element. The xpath for "Continue" element was updated from "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a" to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a" in the new version. This change caused the test case to fail as the test script was unable to locate the element using the old xpath.

Additionally, the removal of the "Manage my account" element could also cause failures in any test cases that interacted with that element in the old version.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpaths for the elements that have changed. Specifically, the xpath for the "Continue" element should be updated to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a" in the test script.

In summary, the test case failed primarily due to the change in the xpath for the "Continue" element and the removal of the "Manage my account" element in the new version of the web application.

The main elements that have changed between the old and new versions are as follows:

1. "My desktop" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[1]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[1]"

2. "My messages" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[2]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[3]"

3. "Platform administration" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[3]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[4]"

4. "Manage my account" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[2]/span/a"
   - Not present in the new version

5. "Logout" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a"

6. "Continue" xpath:
   - Old version: "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a"

Based on the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div"}

The root cause of the test case failure is likely due to the element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" being removed in the new version. This is in line with the note provided that the first element removed is most likely the root cause of the failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the structure of the elements on the page leading to xpath changes.
- Removal of certain elements or addition of new elements impacting the xpath of existing elements.
- Changes in the page layout or design affecting the identification of elements.
- Possible changes in the functionality of the application impacting the availability of certain elements.

To resolve the test case failure, the xpath selector in the test case needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Manage my account" from the old version is missing in the new version. This missing element is most likely the root cause of the test case failure. 

Additionally, there are other changes in the xpath values and text labels for some elements between the old and new versions:
- "My desktop" xpath has changed to "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[1]" in the new version.
- "My messages" xpath has changed to "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[3]" in the new version.
- "Platform administration" xpath has changed to "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[4]" in the new version.
- "Manage my account" is removed in the new version.
- "Logout" xpath has changed to "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a" in the new version.
- "Continue" xpath has changed to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a" in the new version.

The error message indicates that the test case failed due to a NoSuchElementException while trying to locate the element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div". This xpath is not present in either the old or new version's major elements list, which suggests that the test script may be referencing an incorrect xpath causing the failure.

In summary, the root cause of the test case failure is the missing element "Manage my account" in the new version. Other reasons for the failure could be the xpath changes for other elements causing the script to not locate the expected elements. Additionally, the error message points towards a wrong xpath being used in the test script.

Main elements comparison between old and new versions:
1. "My desktop" - xpath locators changed from `//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[1]/span/a` to `//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[1]`
2. "My messages" - xpath locators changed from `//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[2]/span/a` to `//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[3]`
3. "Platform administration" - xpath locators changed from `//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[3]/span/a` to `//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[4]`
4. "Manage my account" - this element is missing in the new version
5. "Logout" - xpath locators changed from `//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a` to `//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a`
6. "Continue" - xpath locators changed from `//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a` to `//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a`

Root cause analysis:
The main reason for the test case failure is the missing "Manage my account" element in the new version. This element was present in the old version but has been removed in the new version, causing the test case to fail when trying to locate it. The error message specifically mentions an element with xpath `//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div`, which could be related to the missing element "Manage my account" as it might have caused a shift in the indexing of elements in the DOM, leading to the failure to locate the expected element.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in the xpath locators of other elements also contribute to the test case failure as the test scripts are unable to locate the elements based on the old xpath locators.
2. The reordering of elements in the user banner and changes in the structure of the elements could also lead to element identification issues.
3. The change in the structure of the "Continue" element might also impact the test case if the script is not updated to handle the new xpath locator.

In conclusion, the removal of the "Manage my account" element and changes in xpath locators are the main reasons for the test case failure, with other element structure changes also contributing to the issue. The test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version to ensure successful test execution.

6. "Continue":
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a"

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. The first element removed ("Manage my account") in the new version is the likely root cause of the test case failure. The test case may have been interacting with this element, and its absence in the new version caused the NoSuchElementException error.

2. Changes in the XPath expressions for "My desktop," "My messages," and "Platform administration" elements indicate that the structure of the user banner has been modified in the new version. Test cases relying on these elements' specific XPath expressions would fail due to the changes.

3. The error message mentioning the missing element with xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" indicates that the test case was looking for an element that no longer exists in the new version. This discrepancy could be due to changes in the HTML structure or element hierarchy.

4. The change in the XPath expression for the "Logout" element from the old to the new version could also cause test case failures if not updated accordingly.

To address the test case failures, update the test scripts to reflect the changes in the element locators and adjust interactions with the user interface elements based on the new version's structure. Additionally, ensure that any dependencies on removed elements are handled appropriately or updated to work with the new version.

However, the error message refers to the element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div", which seems to be different from the main elements provided.

Let's break down the differences between the main elements of the old and new versions:

1. "My desktop":
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[1]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[1]"

2. "My messages":
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[2]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[3]"

3. "Platform administration":
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/div/ul/li[3]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerLeft"]/span[2]/a[4]"

4. "Manage my account":
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[2]/span/a"
   - New version: This element is removed in the new version.

5. "Logout":
   - Old version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a"

6. "Continue":
   - Old version: "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a"
   - New version: "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a"

It appears that the test case failure is due to the element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" which is not present in either the old or new version's main elements. This could be a new element introduced in the updated version that the test case is trying to locate but cannot find, leading to the NoSuchElement exception.

In addition to the missing "Manage my account" element, the restructuring of elements within the user banner (e.g., the change in element positions) could also potentially impact the test case if it relies on specific element positions or sequences.

To address the test case failure, you should update the test case to reflect the changes in the main elements' locators in the new version. Additionally, investigate the presence of the new element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" and adjust the test case logic accordingly if necessary.

2024-10-28 23:13:36,010:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
The broken statement in the test case is trying to locate an element that seems to be invalid in both the old and new versions of the application. Based on the information provided, the element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" does not exist in the new version's HTML structure.

To fix the broken statement, we need to update the assertion related to this element. Since the element "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" is not present in the new version, we should modify the assertion to verify the success message in a different way.

Here is the fixed version of the broken statement:

```java
assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[contains(text(),'The course has been successfully deleted')]")).getText(), "The course has been successfully deleted");
```

This updated statement uses a different XPath locator to find the success message element based on the text content rather than the specific structure of the element. This change should address the NoSuchElement exception and verify the success message correctly in the new version of the application.
2024-10-28 23:13:47,446:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the main changes are as follows:

1. "Manage my account" element is replaced by "My User Account" element.
2. The structure of the xpath for "My desktop," "My messages," and "Platform administration" elements has changed from using a list item index to using anchor tag index in the new version.
3. The xpath for "Logout" element in the new version is simplified.
4. The xpath for the "Continue" element in the new version has changed.

Considering the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div"}", it indicates that the test case failed to locate the element at the specified xpath in the new version.

The most likely root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the "Manage my account" element from the new version. This change could have caused the test case to fail if it was interacting with this element in the old version and is now unable to find it in the new version.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the xpath structure for the elements "My desktop," "My messages," and "Platform administration" could lead to the test case not being able to locate these elements in the new version.
2. The simplified xpath for the "Logout" element may have impacted the test case if it was looking for the element using the old xpath.
3. The change in the xpath for the "Continue" element could also cause the test case to fail if it was interacting with this element.

To resolve the test case failure, you should update the test case to reflect the changes in the element locators and adjust the interactions with the elements based on the new version's structure and xpath.

2024-10-28 23:14:19,979:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following changes have occurred:
1. "Manage my account" element is no longer present in the new version.
2. The xpath for "My desktop," "My messages," "Platform administration," and "Manage my account" elements have changed in the new version.
3. The xpath for the "Logout" element has changed in the new version.
4. The xpath for the "Continue" element has changed in the new version.

Based on the error message provided, it states that the element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" could not be located. However, in the major elements comparison, there is no direct mention of this element in either the old or new version. 

The root cause of the test case failure is most likely the removal of the "Manage my account" element in the new version. This removal has caused a shift in the indexing of elements, leading to xpath changes for other elements as well. As a result, the test case that interacts with the missing "Manage my account" element is failing to locate elements correctly.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the web page causing xpath modifications.
2. Elements being renamed or repositioned on the page.
3. Changes in the underlying code affecting the visibility or accessibility of elements.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpaths of the elements in the new version of the web application. Additionally, any dependencies on the missing "Manage my account" element should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.

2024-10-28 23:14:39,806:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Manage my account" element from the old version is missing in the new version. This element is the first element removed when comparing the two versions.

Root cause of test case failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is the missing "Manage my account" element in the new version. The test case most likely expected this element to be present based on the old version but could not find it in the new version. This resulted in the NoSuchElementException error as the test script tried to locate the element that no longer exists.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in XPath: The XPath for several elements has changed between the old and new versions. This could also lead to test case failure if the test script is looking for elements using the old XPaths which are no longer valid in the new version.
2. Element ordering: The order of elements in the user banner has changed between the two versions. If the test case is dependent on the specific order of elements, it could fail due to this change.
3. Element naming: The names of some elements have been updated in the new version (e.g., "My desktop" changed to "My User Account"). If the test script is searching for elements based on their names, this change could cause failures.

In summary, the main reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "Manage my account" element in the new version, causing the NoSuchElementException error. Other potential reasons for failure include changes in XPath, element ordering, and element naming between the old and new versions.

2024-10-28 23:15:31,873:INFO:Cause of failure 5 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Manage my account" has been removed in the new version, and the xpath for the "Continue" element has changed. The error message indicates that the test case failed due to the inability to locate the element with the xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div".

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
1. The removal of the "Manage my account" element in the new version caused the test case to fail as it was expecting this element to be present based on the old version.
2. The xpath change for the "Continue" element might have also contributed to the failure as the test case was looking for it in the old xpath location.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in element structure or hierarchy could have impacted the xpath locators, leading to element not found errors.
2. Changes in element attributes or IDs could have caused the xpath locators to become invalid.
3. The test script may not have been updated to reflect the changes in the new version, causing it to search for elements that no longer exist or have changed locations.

Recommendations:
1. Update the test script to use the new xpaths for the elements in the new version.
2. Review and adjust the test case logic to accommodate changes in element structure or hierarchy.
3. Regularly maintain and update test scripts to align with changes in the application to prevent future test case failures.
