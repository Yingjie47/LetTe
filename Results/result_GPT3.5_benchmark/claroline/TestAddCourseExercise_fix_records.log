2. Clicks on a specific course.
3. Clicks on "New exercise" within the course.
4. Enters a title for the new exercise.
5. Clicks on an unspecified element on the page.
6. Verifies that the text "Exercise added" is displayed on the page.

Overall, the test case is verifying that the process of adding a new exercise to a course in Claroline is functioning correctly.

2024-10-28 10:57:52,947:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. The "Enter" button:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input"
   - Change: The xpath for the "Enter" button has been modified in the new version.

2. The "Search from keyword" input field and "Search" button are no longer present in the new version.

Given the error message "no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}", it is highly likely that the first element removed, i.e., the "Search" button, is the root cause of the test case failure.

The test case is failing because the test script is trying to locate a button with the CSS selector "button[type="submit"]" which does not exist in the new version. This element might have been previously associated with the "Search" button in the old version, which has been removed in the new version.

To fix this test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version. The script should be modified to interact with the new "Enter" button element instead of the removed "Search" button. Additionally, if the "Search from keyword" input field was critical for the test case, it may need to be added back or the test case adjusted accordingly.

2024-10-28 11:21:38,384:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the main change that might have caused the test case failure is the removal of the element "CS212 - Computer Science" from the xpath "//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a" in the old version to "//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a" in the new version. This change in xpath could lead to the test case failing as the element might not be located in the new version.

Other changes that could also contribute to the test case failure are:

1. The xpath for "View all my messages" changed from "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[2]/div/a" to "//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr[7]/td[1]/div/a".
2. The xpath for "Show/Hide" was completely removed in the new version.
3. The xpath for "View my statistics" was added in the new version.
4. The xpath for "Edit" was added in the new version.

The error message indicates that the element "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a" could not be located. This suggests that the test case is still trying to access an element from the old version's xpath, which no longer exists in the new version. The root cause of the failure is likely due to the test case not being updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the application.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpaths for the elements that have changed or removed in the new version. The test script should be aligned with the updated structure of the web application to ensure successful test execution.

2024-10-28 11:22:30,600:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old version with the new version, the following changes are observed:

1. The xpath for "Create a course site" changed from `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/ul/li[1]/a` in the new version.
2. The xpath for "Edit text zone" changed from `//*[@id="rightSide"]/p[2]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[1]/div[2]/p/a` in the new version.
3. The xpath for "View all my messages" changed from `//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[2]/div/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr[7]/td[1]/div/a` in the new version.
4. The xpath for "Edit text zone" also changed from `//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[1]/div/p[2]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr[8]/td/div/a` in the new version.

Based on the error message provided, it seems that the root cause of the test case failure is due to the xpath change for "CS212 - Computer Science" element. In the old version, the xpath was `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a`, while in the new version, it changed to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a`.

The error message specifically mentions that the element with xpath `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a` could not be located. This suggests that the test script is still referring to the old xpath from the previous version (`//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a`) instead of the updated xpath (`//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a`).

In addition to the root cause, other reasons for the test case failure could be:
- Changes in the structure of the webpage causing the xpath to be outdated.
- Changes in the IDs or classes of the elements leading to xpath modifications.
- Updates in the layout or design of the webpage affecting the location of elements.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the correct xpaths for the elements based on the new version of the web application. Regular maintenance of test scripts to accommodate changes in the application is crucial to ensure the reliability of automated tests.

2024-10-28 11:22:46,330:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following changes have occurred:

1. The xpath for "CS212 - Computer Science" has changed from `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a` in the new version.
2. The element "Edit text zone" has moved from `//*[@id="rightSide"]/p[2]/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[1]/div[2]/p/a` in the new version.
3. The element "View all my messages" has changed its xpath from `//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[2]/div/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr[7]/td[1]/div/a` in the new version.
4. Additionally, the error message indicates that the element `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a` could not be located. It seems that this element has been removed in the new version.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the element `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a` in the new version. This missing element is causing the test case to fail as it cannot be located.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in element locations: The movement of elements like "Edit text zone" and "View all my messages" to different xpaths can also lead to test case failures if the test script is not updated accordingly.
2. Changes in the structure of the page: The restructuring of the page layout can affect the visibility and accessibility of elements, causing test cases to fail.
3. Changes in element identifiers: If the attributes used to identify elements have changed in the new version, it can result in test case failures as the script may not be able to locate the elements accurately.

To address the test case failures, the test scripts need to be updated with the new xpaths and element identifiers based on the changes in the new version of the web application. Additionally, the missing element causing the root cause of the failure should be reviewed to determine if it needs to be included in the updated test scripts or if it is no longer necessary in the new version.

Explanation:
- The xpath `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a` has been updated to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a` based on the changes in the new version of the web application.
2024-10-28 11:23:01,433:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the xpath for "CS212 - Computer Science" has changed from `//*[@id="deskTopLeft"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a` in the new version. This change in xpath is most likely the root cause of the test case failure.

In the error message provided, it is mentioned that the element `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a` could not be located. This xpath does not match any of the major elements listed for either the old or new versions. It seems like there might be a typo in the xpath in the error message. The correct xpath for the element may be `//*[@id="desktopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a` in the old version, but this element is not listed as one of the major elements provided.

Therefore, the test case most likely failed due to the xpath change for "CS212 - Computer Science" element. The test case might be trying to locate the old xpath which no longer exists in the new version, causing the `NoSuchElementException`. Additionally, the typo in the error message xpath might be misleading and not directly related to the failure of the test case.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpath for the "CS212 - Computer Science" element in the new version of the web application.

   - The xpath location changed from "deskTopLeft" to "mainContent".

Root cause of test case failure:
The error message indicates that the element with xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a" could not be located in the new version. This element corresponds to "CS212 - Computer Science" in the old version. The xpath location has changed to "//*[@id="mainContent"]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a" in the new version. This change in xpath location is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in the structure of the elements: The elements have been rearranged and placed in different locations in the new version, leading to xpath changes and element location issues.
2. Renaming of elements: Some elements may have been renamed in the new version, causing the test case to fail if the test script is looking for the old element names.
3. Missing elements: It's possible that some elements present in the old version are no longer available in the new version, causing the test case to fail when trying to locate those elements.

2024-10-28 11:24:04,131:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the main difference is the restructuring of the elements within the page layout. The key change that stands out is the xpath for "CS212 - Computer Science" element, which has shifted from the old version's xpath `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a` to the new version's xpath `//*[@id="campusBanner"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a`.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. **Root Cause - Element XPath Change**: The error message indicates that the test case failed to locate the element using the old xpath `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a`, which was likely the first element removed during the update. This change in the element's xpath is the primary reason for the test case failure.

2. **Element Hierarchy Restructuring**: The restructuring of the page layout is evident from the shift in xpaths for various elements. Elements like "Create a course site," "Enrol on a new course," "Remove course enrollment," and "All platform courses" have also been affected by this layout change. This restructuring might have caused other elements to shift or be removed, leading to test case failures.

3. **Additional Elements Added**: New elements such as "View my statistics," "Edit," "Edit text zone," "Course created: Computer Science," and "View all my messages" have been introduced in the new version. These additions may have impacted the existing elements' visibility or xpath identification, contributing to test failures.

4. **XPath Specificity**: The change in the specificity of xpaths, such as the inclusion of more parent elements or the rearrangement of the hierarchy, can affect the accuracy of element identification. The new xpaths may not match the test scripts' expectations, causing failures.

5. **Missing Error Handling**: The error message indicates a `NoSuchElementException`, which suggests that the test case did not have proper error handling mechanisms to account for element visibility changes or removals during updates. Implementing robust error handling can help in gracefully handling such scenarios and prevent test failures.

In conclusion, the primary reason for the test case failure is the change in the xpath for the "CS212 - Computer Science" element due to the restructuring of the page layout. Additionally, the introduction of new elements and alterations in xpath specificity could have also contributed to the failures. Updating the test scripts to accommodate these changes and incorporating effective error handling can mitigate such issues in the future.

2024-10-28 11:24:28,688:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes that could be the root cause of the test case failure:

1. The xpath for "CS212 - Computer Science" has changed from `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a` in the old version to `//*[@id="campusBanner"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a` in the new version. This change in the xpath for this element could lead to the test case failure as the locator for this element is no longer valid in the new version.

2. Additionally, the error message specifically mentions that it was unable to locate an element with the xpath `//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a`. This xpath was present in the old version but does not exist in the new version. This discrepancy in the xpath could also be a reason for the test case failure.

Based on the information provided, the root cause of the test case failure is likely the change in the xpath for the "CS212 - Computer Science" element. The test case is trying to locate this element using the old xpath, which is no longer valid in the new version, resulting in the `NoSuchElementException`.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpath for the "CS212 - Computer Science" element as per the new version of the application. Additionally, any other outdated xpaths in the test script should be identified and updated accordingly to match the elements in the new version.

1. The main elements in the old version were located under the xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]", whereas the main elements in the new version are located under the xpath "//*[@id="campusBanner"]". This change in the parent element could be a potential reason for the test case failure as the test script may not be able to locate the elements under the new parent element.

2. The element "View all my messages" which was originally located at "//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[2]/div/a" in the old version has been moved to "//*[@id="leftContent"]/div[3]/div[1]/span/a" in the new version. This change in the location of the element could also lead to test case failure as the script might be searching for it in the old location.

3. The error message specifically mentions that it is unable to locate the element with the xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a". This xpath matches with the old version's element "CS212 - Computer Science" which was at "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a". Since this element was removed or its xpath was changed in the new version, it is highly likely that this is the root cause of the test case failure.

4. Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the structure of the HTML elements, changes in the attribute values (like IDs or class names), or changes in the order of elements which can affect the xpath locators used in the test script.

To fix the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpaths corresponding to the main elements in the new version. The script should be modified to use the xpaths of the elements from the new version to interact with the application correctly.

2024-10-28 11:25:59,854:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Main elements that changed between the old and new versions:
1. The xpath for "Create a course site" changed from "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a" to "//*[@id="campusBanner"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/ul/li[1]/a".
2. The xpath for "Enrol on a new course" changed from "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[2]/a" to "//*[@id="campusBanner"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/ul/li[2]/a".
3. The xpath for "Remove course enrolment" changed from "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[3]/a" to "//*[@id="campusBanner"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/ul/li[3]/a".
4. The xpath for "All platform courses" changed from "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[1]/ul/li[4]/a" to "//*[@id="campusBanner"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/ul/li[4]/a".
5. The xpath for "CS212 - Computer Science" changed from "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a" to "//*[@id="campusBanner"]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/dl/dt/span/a".
6. The element "View all my messages" is no longer present in the new version.

Root cause of the test case failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is that the xpath for "View all my messages" element is no longer present in the new version. This is indicated by the error message that mentions the inability to locate the element with the old xpath.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in the xpath of elements: The xpath for several elements has changed between the old and new versions, which can cause the test cases to fail as the automation scripts may not be able to locate the elements in the new version.
2. Addition of new elements: The new version has additional elements like "View my statistics", "Edit", "Edit text zone", and "Course created : Computer Science" which were not present in the old version. These additions can also impact the test cases if they are not accounted for in the automation scripts.
3. Structural changes: The elements in the new version are structured differently within the HTML compared to the old version, which can lead to element locators no longer being valid in the new version.

Overall, the primary reason for the test case failure is the missing "View all my messages" element in the new version, along with changes in the xpath of other elements and the addition of new elements. These differences between the old and new versions have caused the test cases to fail.

2024-10-28 11:26:17,328:INFO:Cause of failure 5 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the major change that likely caused the test case failure is the removal of the element with xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a" from the old version.

Here are the main elements that were present in the old version but are missing in the new version:
1. "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div[2]/dl/dt/span/a"
2. "View all my messages" xpath="//*[@id="desktopRightContent"]/div[2]/div/a"

Based on the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a"}

The error indicates that the test case failed because the element with xpath "//*[@id="dekstopLeftSidebar"]/div/div/div[2]/dl/dt[1]/span/a" could not be located in the new version of the application. This aligns with the observation that the "CS212 - Computer Science" element is missing in the new version.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. **Element Removal**: The main reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "CS212 - Computer Science" element from the left sidebar in the new version. This element was likely a crucial link or navigation point in the test case flow, and its absence caused the test case to fail.
   
2. **XPath Changes**: Apart from the removed element, other elements in the left sidebar have also changed their xpaths in the new version. This might have caused other related test cases to fail due to incorrect xpath locators.

3. **Additional Elements**: The new version introduced new elements such as "View my statistics", "Edit", "Edit text zone" in both the right sidebar and left content sections. These new elements might have altered the layout and structure of the page, impacting the visibility of existing elements.

4. **Multiple Elements with Same XPath**: In the new version, there are multiple occurrences of the element "Course created : Computer Science" with the same xpath. This might lead to ambiguity in element identification and could potentially affect test cases that interact with these elements.

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the application's elements and their xpaths. Specifically, the missing element "CS212 - Computer Science" should be replaced with the updated xpath in the test scripts. Additionally, any other impacted test cases due to xpath changes or new elements should be reviewed and updated accordingly.

2024-10-28 11:30:42,898:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the main change that stands out is the location of the elements within the HTML structure. In the old version, the elements were located under the xpath "//*[@id="courseRightContent"]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/ul/li[x]/a", while in the new version, they are located under "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div/span/a[x]".

The error message indicates that the element with xpath "//*[@id="courseRightContent"]/div[2]/div" could not be located, which aligns with the fact that the elements have been moved to a different location in the new version. The first element "Back to the exercise list" has been removed from its original location "//*[@id="courseRightContent"]/div[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/ul/li[1]/a", which is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Root cause of test case failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is the change in the location of the elements within the HTML structure. The test case is looking for the element in the old location "//*[@id="courseRightContent"]/div[2]/div", which no longer exists in the new version.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Incorrect XPath: If the XPath used in the test case is not accurately updated to reflect the new location of the elements, it can result in test case failure.
2. Changes in element attributes: If there have been changes in the attributes of the elements such as IDs, classes, or names, the test case may fail to locate the elements based on the old attributes.
3. Changes in page layout: If there have been significant changes in the overall layout or structure of the page, the test case may need to be updated to adapt to these changes.

Recommendation:
To address the test case failure, update the test case with the new XPaths of the elements based on the new version's structure. Ensure that the test case reflects the changes accurately to locate and interact with the elements in the updated version of the web application. Additionally, verify other elements and attributes for any further discrepancies that might cause test case failures.
