Test Intent: The test case TestManageUser.java is testing the functionality related to managing users in a web application. The test aims to verify that a user with admin privileges can successfully log in, navigate to the platform administration section, access the manage user desktop, toggle user visibility settings (visible and invisible), and then verify the presence of specific text elements on the page ("My course list" and "Claroline"). Finally, the test case logs out the user.

This test case ensures that the user management features are functioning correctly and that the expected text elements are displayed after performing the necessary actions.

2024-10-28 22:49:31,729:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:
1. The "Enter" button's xpath has changed from `//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button` in the old version to `//*[@id="loginBox"]/div/form/fieldset/input` in the new version.
2. The "Search from keyword" textbox is no longer present in the new version.
3. A new element "CS212 - Computer Science" with xpath `//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[1]/dl/dt/span/a` has been added in the new version.

Given the error message `org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}`, we can infer that the test case is failing because it is unable to locate the "Enter" button, which is the first element removed in the new version. This change in the button's xpath from the old version to the new version is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could be:
1. The removal of the "Search from keyword" textbox may have caused the test case to fail if it was being interacted with in the test scenario.
2. The addition of the "CS212 - Computer Science" element may have altered the layout or functionality of the page, leading to issues in locating other elements or performing actions on the page.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the element locators and the test scenario adjusted accordingly. The test script should be modified to interact with the new "Enter" button element using its updated xpath in the new version of the web application. Additionally, any references to the removed "Search from keyword" textbox should be updated or removed from the test script.
