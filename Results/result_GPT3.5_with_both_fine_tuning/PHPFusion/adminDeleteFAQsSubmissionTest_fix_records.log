Test Intent: The test case adminDeleteFAQsSubmissionTest.py is performing an end-to-end test scenario to validate the functionality of deleting a FAQ submission as an admin user on the PHPFusion-9.10.30 web application.

1. The test case logs in as an admin user.
2. Navigates to the FAQ administration section after entering the admin password.
3. Clicks on a specific FAQ submission to delete it.
4. Clicks on the delete button to confirm the deletion.
5. Logs out of the admin account.

Overall, the test case aims to verify that the admin user can successfully delete a FAQ submission from the system.

2024-05-22 22:04:09,338:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
The main elements that have changed between the old and new versions are the buttons at the bottom of the form. In the old version, there were specific buttons for preview, publish, and delete with the xpaths:
- (preview button at the bottom) xpath="//*[@id="preview_submission-formend"]"
- (publish button at the bottom) xpath="//*[@id="publish_submission-formend"]"
- (delete button at the bottom) xpath="//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]"

In the new version, these buttons have been replaced with more generic buttons:
- "Preview" xpath="//*[@id="preview_submission"]"
- "Publish" xpath="//*[@id="publish_submission"]"
- "Delete" xpath="//*[@id="delete_submission"]"

The error message indicates that the test case failed because it was unable to locate the element with the xpath "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]". This xpath corresponds to the old version's delete button at the bottom of the form, which no longer exists in the new version.

The root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the specific delete button at the bottom of the form in the new version. Since the test case was trying to interact with this element based on its old xpath, it failed to locate it in the updated version.

To fix the test case, you need to update the test script to interact with the new delete button element with the xpath "//*[@id="delete_submission"]" instead of the old xpath. Additionally, you may need to update the xpaths for the preview and publish buttons at the bottom of the form as well to match the new version's elements.

In summary, the test case failed because the specific delete button element at the bottom of the form was removed in the new version, causing the test script to be unable to locate the element based on its old xpath.

2024-05-22 22:04:23,534:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
According to the new version of the HTML, there is no element with the id "admin_password" or "admin-login-form" mentioned in the possible cause of test failure, which can be understood as being irrelevant to the current test intent. Therefore, you should not need to change or delete any test steps in the test case.
The xpath in the error message is "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]", but in the possible cause of test failure you mentioned that the xpath of the delete button is "//*[@id="delete_submission"]", so you should change the xpath in the test case to "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".
At the same time, to prevent similar errors from happening again, you should also change the xpath of the preview and publish buttons in the test case to "//*[@id="preview_submission"]" and "//*[@id="publish_submission"]", respectively.

Based on the new version of the HTML, the specific delete, preview, and publish buttons are indeed no longer at the bottom of the form. The three buttons are now at the top of the form.
So, in order to fix the test case, you need to change the xpath to "//*[@id="delete_submission"]" to "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]", to "//*[@id="preview_submission"]" to "//*[@id="preview_submission-formend"]", to "//*[@id="publish_submission"]" to "//*[@id="publish_submission-formend"]".

Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be concluded that the root cause of the failure of the test lies in the changes in the three buttons at the bottom of the form.
But from the new version of the HTML, I found that the xpath of the button "Preview" is "//*[@id="preview_submission"]", the xpath of the button "Publish" is "//*[@id="publish_submission"]", and the xpath of the button "Delete" is "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".
So in order to keep the original test intent and just fix the failing test case, you only need to replace the xpath "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]" with "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".

According to the new HTML, the "Preview", "Publish", and "Delete" buttons are all contained in a <form> element.
The root cause of the test case failure is that the "delete_submission-formend" element could not be found. At the same time, the error message provided can also be understood as that the xpath has an error.
This can be inferred to be the xpath of the old version of the test case. 
And the new version of the HTML contains a <form> element with an id of "submissionform", which contains the "Preview", "Publish", and "Delete" buttons, each of which has an id that matches the new xpath.
So, to fix the test case you only need to replace "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]" with "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".

The error message says that the xpath "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]" could not be found, but according to the new version of the HTML, the xpath "//*[@id="delete_submission"]" does exist.
So to fix the test case, all you need to do is change "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]" to "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".

Based on the possible causes of test failure you provided, the xpath for the preview button at the bottom of the form is "//*[@id="preview_submission"]", the xpath for the publish button is "//*[@id="publish_submission"]", and the xpath for the delete button is "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".
However, according to the new version of the HTML, I found that the xpath for the preview button is "//*[@id="preview_submission"]", the xpath for the publish button is "//*[@id="publish_submission"]", and the xpath for the delete button is "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".
So, in order to prevent the same problem from happening, you need to change the xpaths in the test case in the same way.
The test case provided has no element with the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-faq_admin"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/a", but it does have an element with the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-faq_admin"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/a".
According to the new version of the HTML, it is a delete button for the FAQ submission, which is consistent with the test intent.
