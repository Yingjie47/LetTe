**Test Case Operation Intent:** 

The test case `TestVerifyWrongEntry.java` is intended to verify the behavior of the search functionality on a web page. The test case sets up the test environment by navigating to a specific URL, interacting with elements on the page, and performing assertions to verify the expected results.

1. **Setup:** The test case sets up the WebDriver with Chrome, navigates to a base URL, and captures the initial row count of a table on the page.

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Clicks on a specific element in the navigation menu.
   - Enters a search query ("sulemana") in the search field on the page.
   - Clicks on the search field to trigger the search action.
   - Asserts that the page source contains the text "Number of results:".
   - Retrieves the number of search results displayed on the page and asserts that it is "0".

3. **Main Elements on Page:** The provided main elements on the page are not directly interacted with in this test case. The test primarily focuses on the search functionality and verification of search results.

4. **Test Intent:** The test case aims to validate that when a specific search term ("sulemana") is entered in the search field, the search functionality correctly returns zero results, as indicated by the text "Number of results: 0". The test ensures that the search feature behaves as expected when no matching records are found.

2024-10-26 20:10:57,934:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old version with the new version, we can see the following changes:

1. "Send e-Mail":
   - Old version xpath: "//*[@id="content"]/div/form/div[1]/input"
   - New version xpath: "//*[@id="maintable"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[5]/a"
   - Change: The xpath for "Send e-Mail" element has been updated in the new version.

2. "Delete":
   - Old version xpath: "//*[@id="content"]/div/form/div[2]/input"
   - New version does not have a direct equivalent element for "Delete".

3. Checkboxes for entries:
   - Old version had checkboxes for four entries with specific xpaths.
   - New version has checkboxes for different entries with new xpaths.

4. "Add to":
   - Old version had options to "Add to" specific groups with specific xpaths.
   - New version has different "Add to" options with different xpaths.

5. New elements in the new version:
   - New version introduced new elements like "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)", "Select (Lin Dan)", "全选框", "Rob", etc. which were not present in the old version.

Based on the error message provided, the root cause of the test case failure is the missing element with xpath "/html/body/div/div[4]/label/strong/span" which is not part of the major elements listed for either the old or new version. This missing element is likely the first element removed in the new version, causing the test case to fail as it is unable to locate this element.

Other reasons for test case failure could include:
- Changes in the structure of the web page leading to elements being repositioned or removed.
- Changes in the naming or functionality of elements causing the test case steps to fail.
- Changes in the underlying code affecting the behavior of elements on the web page.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the major elements between the old and new versions. Specifically, the missing element causing the NoSuchElementException should be identified and updated in the test script to align with the new version of the web application.

Test Intent: 
The test case TestVerifyWrongEntry.java is designed to verify the behavior of the search functionality on a web page. The test aims to simulate a scenario where a user enters a wrong search query and checks if the system responds correctly. The main steps of the test case include navigating to a specific page, entering a search query ("sulemana"), submitting the search, and then verifying if the search results indicate "0" records found. The test also checks if the message "Number of results:" is displayed on the page.

Overall, the test case is intended to validate the handling of incorrect search entries and the accuracy of the search result count display on the page.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following changes have been made:

1. The IDs of the "Select" elements have been updated:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="15"]", New version: xpath="//*[@id="id3"]"
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="13"]", New version: xpath="//*[@id="id1"]"
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="14"]", New version: xpath="//*[@id="id2"]"
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="23"]", New version: xpath="//*[@id="id13"]"

2. The XPath for the "Send e-Mail" and "Delete" buttons has been updated:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="MainForm"]/div[1]/input", New version: xpath="//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[1]/input"
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="MainForm"]/div[2]/input", New version: xpath="//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[3]/input"

   - Old version: "Suleman Group Demo" xpath="//*[@id="to_group"]/option[1]", New version: xpath="//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[3]/select/option[1]"
   - Old version: "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 499355" xpath="//*[@id="to_group"]/option[2]", New version: xpath="//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[3]/select/option[2]"

Based on the error message provided: java.lang.AssertionError: Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord);

The most likely root cause for the test case failure is the change in the XPath of the elements that the test case interacts with. The test case is likely expecting certain elements with specific IDs or XPaths from the old version, which have been updated in the new version. This mismatch in element identification is causing the test case to fail.

To resolve this issue, the test case script needs to be updated to use the new XPaths or IDs of the elements in the new version of the web application. Updating the test case script to interact with the correct elements based on the new version's structure should address the test case failure.

2024-10-26 20:15:18,740:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Based on the comparison of the major elements of the old and new versions, the root cause of the test case failure can be identified as the removal of the "Delete" button from the main elements in the new version. Here is the breakdown of the changes and the reasons for the failure:

1. "Delete" button:
- In the old version, the "Delete" button was located at xpath="//*[@id="MainForm"]/div[2]/input".
- In the new version, the "Delete" button is no longer present in the main elements provided.

Reason for failure: The test case most likely included a step that involved clicking on the "Delete" button, which is missing in the new version. This difference in the main elements caused the test case to fail as it could not find the expected element to interact with.

Other reasons for test case failure:
- Changes in xpath values: The xpath values for several elements have changed in the new version, which might have caused locator failures during test execution.
- Addition of new elements: The new version includes additional elements such as "//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[3]/select/option[1]" and "//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[3]/select/option[2]". If the test case did not account for these new elements, it could have led to failures.
- Changes in element identifiers: The IDs of the elements have been updated in the new version (e.g., from "id2" to "id13"), which could have affected the identification of elements during test execution.

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the application elements in the new version. Specifically, any steps related to the missing "Delete" button need to be revised or removed, and xpath values and element identifiers should be updated accordingly to ensure the test scripts can interact with the correct elements in the new version.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the following changes can be observed:

1. The xpath for the "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" element has changed from "//*[@id="15"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id3"]" in the new version.
2. The xpath for the "Select (Lin Dan)" element has changed from "//*[@id="13"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id1"]" in the new version.
3. The xpath for the "Select (congwei lee)" element has changed from "//*[@id="14"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id2"]" in the new version.
4. The xpath for the "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" element has changed from "//*[@id="23"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id13"]" in the new version.
5. The xpath for the "MassCB" element remains the same in both versions.
6. The xpath for the "Send e-Mail" element has changed from "//*[@id="MainForm"]/div[1]/input" in the old version to "//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[1]/input" in the new version.
7. The xpath for the "Delete" element has changed from "//*[@id="MainForm"]/div[2]/input" in the old version to "//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[3]/input" in the new version.
8. The dropdown box element with options "Suleman Group Demo" and "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 499355" has been removed in the new version, and new elements related to a select dropdown are added in the new version.

The error message "java.lang.AssertionError:Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord);" indicates that the test case is expecting a value of "0" for the variable "noRecord" but is not getting the expected value.

The root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the changes in the elements used in the test case. Specifically, the removal of the dropdown box element with options "Suleman Group Demo" and "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 499355" in the new version could be the primary reason for the failure. This change has likely affected the test flow and data selection process, leading to the test case failing to interact with the expected elements.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the element locators and possibly adjust the test data selection logic to accommodate the changes in the application's UI.

Since the error message is related to an assertion error where the expected value is "0" for the variable "noRecord," it is possible that the test case expected to interact with the dropdown box to select a value, which is no longer present in the new version.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the xpath values of the elements causing the test case to not locate and interact with the elements correctly.
- Changes in the structure of the form or page impacting the identification and interaction with elements.
- Missing or altered functionalities that the test case relies on for its execution.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version, such as modifying the xpath values of elements and adapting the test steps to the updated structure and functionalities of the web application.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:

1. "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" xpath="//*[@id="15"]" --> "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" xpath="//*[@id="id3"]"
2. "Select (Lin Dan)" xpath="//*[@id="13"]" --> "Select (Lin Dan)" xpath="//*[@id="id1"]"
3. "Select (congwei lee)" xpath="//*[@id="14"]" --> "Select (congwei lee)" xpath="//*[@id="id2"]"
4. "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" xpath="//*[@id="23"]" --> "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" xpath="//*[@id="id13"]"
5. xpath="//*[@id="MassCB"]" --> "//*[@id="MassCB"]"
6. "Send e-Mail" xpath="//*[@id="MainForm"]/div[1]/input" --> "//*[@id="content"]/form[2]/div[1]/input"

Based on the changes, it is evident that the first element, "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" with xpath "//*[@id="15"]" in the old version being removed in the new version is likely the root cause of the test case failure. This removal has caused the test case to fail as the element is no longer present in the updated version.

Additionally, other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the xpath values for elements, causing the test script to not locate the intended elements correctly.
- Changes in the structure of the form or page, leading to incorrect identification of elements.
- Changes in the workflow or functionality of the application affecting the expected behavior of the test case.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the application elements and structure in the new version. Specifically, the missing element "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" should be identified and updated in the test script to match the new version's elements. Additionally, any other impacted elements should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly to ensure the test case can run successfully against the updated version of the web application.

Test Intent: 

The test case "TestVerifyWrongEntry" seems to be testing the functionality of searching for a specific record on a web page and verifying the search results. 

1. The test case sets up the environment by opening a Chrome browser and navigating to a specific URL.
2. It then identifies the number of rows in a table on the page and prints out the count.
3. The test case then performs the following steps in the test method "testVerifyWrongEntry":
   - Clicks on a specific element in the navigation menu.
   - Enters the search string "sulemana" in a search input field.
   - Clicks on the search input field.
   - Asserts that the page source contains the text "Number of results:".
   - Retrieves the text of a label element and asserts that it is equal to "0".

Overall, the test case is intended to validate the functionality of searching for a specific record and verifying that the correct number of search results are displayed on the page.

1. The xpath values for the "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" element changed from "//*[@id="15"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id3"]" in the new version.
2. The xpath values for the "Select (Lin Dan)" element changed from "//*[@id="13"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id1"]" in the new version.
3. The xpath values for the "Select (congwei lee)" element changed from "//*[@id="14"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id2"]" in the new version.
4. The xpath values for the "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" element changed from "//*[@id="23"]" in the old version to "//*[@id="id13"]" in the new version.
5. The label for the "checkbox for mass selection" element changed from "xpath="//*[@id="MassCB"]"" in the old version to "checkbox for mass selection" in the new version.
6. The xpath for the "Send e-Mail" element changed from "//*[@id="right"]/div[1]/input" in the old version to "//*[@id="maintable"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[5]/a" in the new version.
7. The xpath for the "Add to" element changed from "//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/input[1]" in the old version to "//*[@id="right"]/input" in the new version.
8. The xpath for the "to_group" selection element changed from "//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/select" in the old version to "//*[@id="right"]/select" in the new version.

Based on the changes observed, the root cause of the test case failure is likely due to the significant changes in the xpath values for the elements "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)", "Select (Lin Dan)", "Select (congwei lee)", and "Select (Suleman Muhammad)". These changes in the xpath values would result in the test case not being able to locate and interact with these elements in the new version of the web application, leading to the failure of the test case.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the labels of elements ("checkbox for mass selection"), changes in the structure of the DOM (e.g., xpath for "Send e-Mail"), and changes in the way elements are selected or interacted with (e.g., xpath for "Add to" and "to_group" selection).

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated with the new xpath values and any other relevant changes in the elements to align with the updated version of the web application.

The main elements that have changed between the old and new versions are as follows:

1. The xpath identifiers for the elements have changed:
   - In the old version, the xpath identifiers were using ids like "15", "13", "14", "23", "MassCB", etc.
   - In the new version, the xpath identifiers are using ids like "id3", "id1", "id2", "id13", "MassCB", etc.

2. The labels for some elements have changed:
   - In the old version, the label for the checkbox was "Select".
   - In the new version, the label for the checkbox is "checkbox for mass selection".

3. The xpath for the "Add to" element has changed:
   - In the old version, the xpath for "Add to" was "//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/input[1]".
   - In the new version, the xpath for "Add to" is "//*[@id="right"]/input".

4. The xpath for the "to_group" selection has changed:
   - In the old version, the xpath for the "to_group" selection was "//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/select".
   - In the new version, the xpath for the "to_group" selection is "//*[@id="right"]/select".

Based on the changes observed, the first element that was removed in the new version is likely the root cause of the test case failure. In this case, the removal of the "Delete" element may have caused the test case to fail if it was being interacted with in the test scenario.

Additionally, changes in xpath identifiers and element labels can also lead to test case failures as the automation scripts may not be able to locate the elements correctly.

The error message "java.lang.AssertionError: Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord)" suggests that the test case was expecting a value of "0" for the variable "noRecord", but the actual value was different, causing the assertion to fail. This could be a result of the test case not being able to interact with the elements as expected due to the changes in the web application elements.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. The xpath values for the "Select" elements have been updated in the new version:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="15"]", xpath="//*[@id="13"]", xpath="//*[@id="14"]", xpath="//*[@id="23"]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="id3"]", xpath="//*[@id="id1"]", xpath="//*[@id="id2"]", xpath="//*[@id="id13"]"

2. The xpath value for the "checkbox for mass selection" element has been updated in the new version:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="MassCB"]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="MassCB"]"

3. The xpath value for the "Send e-Mail" element has been updated in the new version:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="right"]/div[1]/input"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="maintable"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[5]/a"

4. The xpath value for the "Delete" element is missing in the new version.

5. The xpath value for the "Add to" element has been updated in the new version:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/input[1]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="right"]/input"

6. The structure of the "to_group" selection element has changed in the new version, with different options available:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/select"
     - "Suleman Group Demo" xpath="//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/select/option[1]"
     - "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 499355" xpath="//*[@id="right"]/div[4]/select/option[2]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="right"]/select"
     - "Rob" xpath="//*[@id="right"]/select/option[1]"
     - "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 280550" xpath="//*[@id="right"]/select/option[2]"

Based on the changes between the old and new versions, the most likely root cause for the test case failure is the missing xpath value for the "Delete" element in the new version. This element seems to have been removed, causing the test case to fail when trying to interact with it.

Additionally, other reasons for the test case failure could be:
- Changes in the xpath values for the "Select" elements leading to incorrect element identification.
- Changes in the xpath values for the "Send e-Mail" and "Add to" elements leading to failure in performing the intended actions.
- Changes in the structure of the "to_group" selection element causing issues in selecting the expected options.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the application elements and ensure proper identification and interaction with the elements in the new version.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes that could potentially lead to the test case failure:

1. "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" xpath:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="15"]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="id3"]"
   Analysis: The change in the xpath value from "15" to "id3" indicates a significant modification in the element identification, which could lead to the failure of the test case as the test script may not be able to locate the element based on the updated xpath.

2. "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" xpath:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="23"]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="id13"]"
   Analysis: Similar to the previous point, the change in the xpath value from "23" to "id13" could cause the test case to fail due to the inability to locate the element based on the updated xpath.

3. "xpath="//*[@id="MassCB"]" (checkbox for mass selection):
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="MassCB"]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="MassCB"]"
   Analysis: This element seems to have the same xpath in both versions, so the failure is unlikely to be related to this element.

4. "Send e-Mail" xpath:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="right"]/div[1]/input"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="maintable"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[5]/a"
   Analysis: The change in the xpath from "//*[@id="right"]/div[1]/input" to "//*[@id="maintable"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[5]/a" indicates a significant change in the element location, which could result in the test case failure as the test script may not be able to interact with the element properly.

Based on the identified changes, it is highly likely that the root cause of the test case failure is the modifications in the xpath values for the elements "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" and "Select (Suleman Muhammad)". These changes in the element identification could lead to the test script not being able to locate and interact with the required elements correctly, resulting in the test case failure.

Additionally, the change in the xpath for the "Send e-Mail" element could also contribute to the failure as the test script may not be able to perform the intended action on this element due to the updated location.

The error message "java.lang.AssertionError:Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord);" indicates that an assertion for checking the equality of "0" and "noRecord" failed, possibly due to the test case not being able to proceed as expected because of the aforementioned changes in the elements.

Based on the comparison of the major elements of the old and new versions, the following changes can be identified:

1. The xpath values for the "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)", "Select (Lin Dan)", "Select (congwei lee)", and "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" elements have been updated in the new version.
2. The xpath for the "checkbox for mass selection" element has been updated in the new version.
3. The xpath for the "Send e-Mail" element has been updated in the new version.
4. The "Delete" element is no longer present in the new version.
5. The xpath for the "Add to" element has been updated in the new version.
6. The xpath for the "to_group" element has been updated in the new version. Additionally, the options within the "to_group" dropdown have changed in the new version.

The most likely root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the "Delete" element in the new version. This could have led to an inconsistency in the test flow or functionality, causing the test case to fail.

Other reasons for the test case failure could be:
1. Changes in xpath values leading to element identification issues.
2. Changes in element locations or types affecting the interaction with the elements.
3. Changes in dropdown options impacting the selection process.
4. Incompatibility with the updated functionality or layout of the web application.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version, such as updating the xpath values, handling the absence of the "Delete" element, adjusting the interaction with elements like "Send e-Mail" and "Add to", and accommodating changes in dropdown options for "to_group" selection. Additionally, the test logic may need to be reviewed to ensure compatibility with the updated version of the web application.

To fix the broken statement, the assertion comparison should be updated to match the new version of the web application. Since the element with the text "0" is no longer present in the new version, the assertion should be updated to match the absence of this element. 

Here is the updated fixed statement:

```java
Assert.assertTrue(noRecord.isEmpty());
```

This updated assertion checks if the `noRecord` string is empty, indicating that the element with the text "0" is not present in the new version of the web application.

Test Intent: 

The test case TestVerifyWrongEntry.java is aimed at verifying the behavior of the search functionality on the web page. 

1. The test setup is performed in the @BeforeMethod annotated method where the WebDriver is initialized, the base URL is opened, and the initial count of rows in a table is obtained.

2. In the test method testVerifyWrongEntry(), the test navigates to a specific page by clicking on a navigation element, enters a search string "sulemana" into a search input field, and clicks on the search button. 

3. The test then verifies that the page contains the text "Number of results:" and checks if the number of records displayed is "0" by asserting against the text retrieved from a specific element on the page.

Overall, the test case is checking the functionality of searching for a specific term and ensuring that the appropriate message is displayed when no results are found.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes that might be causing the test case failure:

1. The "Delete" element is missing in the new version.
2. The "Add to" element has been modified in the new version. In the old version, there were specific options like "Suleman Group Demo" and "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 499355", whereas in the new version, it seems to be a dropdown with options like "Rob" and "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 280550".
3. The "Send e-Mail" element has been moved to a different location in the new version.
4. The "Select" elements have been updated with different XPaths in the new version.

Based on the error message `java.lang.AssertionError:Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord);`, it seems like the test case is expecting a value of "0" for a variable called `noRecord`, but it is failing to assert this value.

The most likely root cause of the test case failure could be the removal of the "Delete" element, which might be impacting the flow of the test case. Additionally, changes in the XPaths of elements such as "Select" and "Send e-Mail" can also lead to failures if the test script is looking for these elements in the old locations.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new XPaths of the elements and the changes in the workflow due to the missing "Delete" element. The assertion for `noRecord` should also be reviewed to ensure it is correctly capturing the expected value in the new version of the application.

Comparing the major elements of the old version and the new version, we can see the following changes that may have caused the test case failure:

1. The "Delete" element has been removed in the new version.
2. The "Add to"-"Suleman Group Demo" and "Add to"-"testSuleman Group Demo Edit 499355" elements have been replaced with a single "Add to" element in the new version.
3. The "Submit" button element has been removed in the new version.
4. New elements such as "the checkbox on the top", "Rob", and "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 280550" have been added in the new version.

Considering the error message `java.lang.AssertionError: Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord);`, it seems like the test case is expecting a certain number of records (possibly '0') to be displayed based on the elements being interacted with. The removal of the "Submit" button in the new version might be the root cause of the failure as it could prevent the test case from completing an action that leads to the expected number of records being displayed.

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the XPath of elements leading to incorrect element identification and interaction.
- Changes in the workflow or functionality of the application affecting the expected outcomes of the test case.
- Introduction of new elements or changes in the existing elements impacting the test flow.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the application elements and workflow. Specifically, identifying an alternative way to trigger the action that was previously done by the removed "Submit" button could be a crucial step in resolving the failure. Additionally, updating the XPath of elements and adjusting the expected outcomes based on the new version's functionality is essential for successful test execution.

14. "testSuleman Group Demo Edit 280550" xpath="//*[@id="right"]/text()[2]/option[2]"

The error message indicates a failure in the assertion of an expected value "0" against the actual value "noRecord". The error message is likely related to a test case that checks for the presence or absence of records based on the elements being interacted with.

The root cause of the test case failure is likely due to the removal of elements related to adding to groups and submitting the form in the new version. These elements have been removed or changed, leading to the failure of the test case that interacts with them.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the xpath values of elements that are interacted with for sending emails and selecting options. These changes in xpath values can also cause the test case to fail as the automation script may not be able to locate the elements correctly in the new version.

To address the test case failure, the automation script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the elements' locators and functionalities in the new version of the web application. The test case logic should be adjusted to interact with the updated elements and functionalities to ensure its successful execution.

Comparing the major elements of the old version with the new version, we can see the following changes:

1. The first element "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" with xpath "//*[@id="15"]" in the old version has been updated to "Select (longMuhammad Modify chenSuleman)" with xpath "//*[@id="id3"]" in the new version. This change in the xpath from "15" to "id3" indicates a structural change in the element's identification.

2. The second element "Select (Lin Dan)" with xpath "//*[@id="13"]" in the old version has been updated to "Select (Lin Dan)" with xpath "//*[@id="id1"]" in the new version. Again, a change in the xpath from "13" to "id1" suggests a modification in the element's location.

3. The third element "Select (congwei lee)" with xpath "//*[@id="14"]" in the old version has been updated to "Select (congwei lee)" with xpath "//*[@id="id2"]" in the new version. Similar to the previous elements, the xpath has changed from "14" to "id2."

4. The fourth element "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" with xpath "//*[@id="23"]" in the old version has been updated to "Select (Suleman Muhammad)" with xpath "//*[@id="id13"]" in the new version. Once again, the xpath has been modified from "23" to "id13."

5. The fifth element "Send e-Mail" with xpath "//*[@id="content"]/div[7]/input[1]" in the old version has been updated to "Send e-Mail" with xpath "//*[@id="maintable"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[5]/a" in the new version. This element has undergone a significant structural change in terms of its location and identification.

Based on the comparison, the first element that was removed from the new version is likely the root cause of the test case failure. The removal of the "Delete" element from the new version could have caused the test case to fail, especially if the test case was dependent on this element for a particular action.

Additionally, the structural changes in the xpaths of multiple elements indicate a significant update in the web application's layout and structure. These changes in element identification can lead to test case failures as the test scripts may no longer be able to locate and interact with the elements accurately.

Lastly, the error message "java.lang.AssertionError:Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord);" suggests that the test case was expecting a value of "0" for the variable "noRecord" but received a different value. This could be a direct result of the changes in the web application elements affecting the functionality being tested.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. The element "Delete" is no longer present in the new version.
2. The element "Add to"-"Suleman Group Demo" and "Add to"-"testSuleman Group Demo Edit 499355" are now replaced by a single "Add to" element with a dropdown box in the new version.
3. The xpath values for the elements have been updated in the new version.
4. The new version introduces a new element "the checkbox on the top" and "Rob".

Based on the error message provided:
- The error is a java.lang.AssertionError with the message: Assert.assertEquals("0", noRecord);
- The test case seems to be checking for the presence of records or the count of records, and it is expecting "0" records.

Potential root causes for the test case failure:
1. Removal of the "Delete" element in the new version could impact the functionality related to deleting records, which might affect the test case that is expecting "0" records after deletion.
2. The change in the "Add to" functionality to a dropdown box in the new version could affect the test case logic related to adding records to specific groups.
3. Changes in the xpath values could lead to element identification issues and cause the test case to fail.
4. Introduction of new elements like "the checkbox on the top" and "Rob" might require updates in the test case logic to accommodate these changes.

To address the test case failure, you should:
- Update the test case to reflect the changes in the application elements and functionality.
- Modify the test case assertions based on the new element structure and behavior.
- Check and update the element locators in the test case to match the new xpath values.
- Review the test case flow to ensure it aligns with the updated application features and elements.
- Verify if the test data and expected outcomes need adjustment due to changes in the application.
