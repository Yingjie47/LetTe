2024-09-16 22:57:58,408:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes that may have caused the test case failure:

1. The "Delete" button in the old version had the xpath `//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]`, while in the new version, the xpath for the "Delete" button is `//*[@id="delete_submission"]`. This change in the xpath selector for the "Delete" button is the most likely root cause of the test case failure, as indicated in the note provided.

Other changes that may have contributed to the test case failure include:
- The addition of a "Back" button in the new version, which was not present in the old version.
- The renaming of the "Preview" button in the old version to "Preview" and "Publish" in the new version, with updated xpaths.
- The removal of the "¡Á" button from the new version, which was present in the old version.
- The xpath for the "Preview" button has changed from `//*[@id="preview_submission-formend"]` in the old version to `//*[@id="preview_submission"]` in the new version.

The error message `NoSuchElementException` indicates that the test case failed because the test automation tool (likely Selenium) was unable to locate the element with the xpath `//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]` in the new version of the application. This is consistent with the root cause identified above, where the xpath for the "Delete" button has been updated in the new version, leading to the element not being found during the test execution.

To address this test case failure, the test automation script needs to be updated with the correct xpath for the "Delete" button in the new version of the application. The script should be modified to use the xpath `//*[@id="delete_submission"]` instead of the old xpath `//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]`. Additionally, any other xpath changes between the old and new versions should be identified and updated in the test automation script to ensure the tests can locate the elements correctly in the updated application version.

2024-09-16 22:58:10,035:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
By understanding the possible root causes of test failures, it can be seen that the xpath of the "Delete" button has changed. And from the new version of the HTML, you can see that the id of the "Delete" button is "delete_submission" and not "delete_submission-formend".
So in order to fix the test case, you need to change '//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]' to '//*[@id="delete_submission"]'.
The root cause of the error in the error message is consistent with the possible causes of test failure you provided.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to change '//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]' to '//*[@id="delete_submission"]'.
In addition, I noticed that in the new version of the HTML, there is no longer any "¡Á" button, so there is no need to test it.

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")

2024-09-16 22:58:10,035:INFO:The testcase 1-2 is generated:
According to the possible causes of test failure and the error message, it can be speculated that the "Delete" button element has been changed. Through searching the new version of the HTML for the "Delete" button, I found that the xpath is `//*[@id="delete_submission"]`.
At the same time, the xpath contained in the error message is inconsistent with the original xpath, so it is likely that the xapth has been changed or the id of the element has been changed.

The original test case had an xpath with "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]", and in the new version of the HTML, no similar element was found with that id, and only the "Delete" button was found with the id "delete_submission".
In order to fully understand the new version of the HTML, a few lines of code are extracted from the original test case to try to search for the exact error message in the new version of the HTML. As a result, no such element was found in the new version of the HTML. But by changing the xpath to "//*[@id="delete_submission"]", the element was found in the HTML.
So the error is likely to be caused by a change in the "Delete" button element.
At the same time, it is possible that there may have been some minor changes to other elements in the new version of the HTML, such as the addition of a "Back" button.

The fixed test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_name"])[2]').send_keys("admin")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_pass"])[2]').send_keys("admin123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="login"]').click()

driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="navigation-user"]/ul/li[5]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin_password"]').send_keys("root1234")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin-login-form"]/div/div/button').click()

2024-09-16 22:58:10,035:INFO:The testcase 1-3 is generated:
The "Delete" button in the new version of the HTML has an id of `delete_submission`, not `delete_submission-formend`.
This is consistent with the error message in the test case.
So changing the xpath to `//*[@id="delete_submission"]` can fix the test case.

Based on the new version of the HTML, it can be determined that the "¡Á" button mentioned in the possible cause of failure is not deleted, but it is in the iframe and has no real impact on the test case.
And the so-called "Back" button was not found in the new version of the HTML, which is not consistent with the new HTML.
And the "Preview" button and "Publish" button have nothing to do with the test case, as can be seen from the new test case.

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_name"])[2]').send_keys("admin")

2024-09-16 22:58:10,035:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
According to the new version of the HTML, it can be found that there is no "Back" button you mentioned, and the "Preview" and "Publish" buttons are not in the location specified in the error message, nor are they in the location specified in the test case, and the only "Delete" button you mentioned is indeed id "delete_submission".
So the only change is the "Delete" button.
Therefore, the xpath "//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]" in the test case needs to be changed to "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_name"])[2]').send_keys("admin")

2024-09-16 22:58:10,035:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
By comparing the new HTML and the reported error message, it can be found that the id of the "Delete" button has been changed to "delete_submission".
So to fix this test case, you just need to replace '//*[@id="delete_submission-formend"]' with '//*[@id="delete_submission"]'.
In addition, by comparing the new HTML and the test case, it can be found that there are no "Back" and "¡Á" buttons in the new version of the HTML, and there is no "Preview" button, only "Preview" and "Publish".
According to the possible causes of test failure, the "Preview" button should not have been tested in the old version of the test case, so there is no need to test it in the new version of the test case.
Similarly, the "¡Á" button was not tested in the old version of the test case, and was mentioned in the error message, but by comparing it with the new HTML, it was found that there was no such button in the new version, so there is no need to test it in the new version of the test case.
There is no "Back" button in the new version of the HTML, but it was tested in the old test case, and according to the error message, there was no such element in the new version of the HTML, so the test step that tests the "Back" button needs to be deleted in the new version of the test case.
