2024-09-16 12:52:39,092:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the most significant change that stands out is the absence of the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons in the new version. Based on the error message provided ("selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable"), it is highly likely that the removal of these elements is the root cause of the test case failure.

Here are the reasons for the test case failure and the potential root cause:

1. Missing Elements:
   - The "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons, which were present in the old version, are no longer available in the new version. This absence directly resulted in the "element not interactable" error when the test case tried to interact with these buttons that are no longer present.

2. XPath Changes:
   - The XPath values for the elements have changed significantly between the old and new versions. This change in XPath values could also lead to test case failures as the automation script may not be able to locate the elements using the updated XPaths.

3. Functionality Changes:
   - The new version introduces new elements such as "Add New Page," "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" buttons, indicating a shift in functionality and user interface. These changes could impact the flow of the test case and cause failures if the automation script is not updated to accommodate these changes.

4. Environment Changes:
   - The introduction of new elements and removal of existing elements suggest a broader overhaul of the web application. Changes in the underlying environment or architecture could also contribute to test case failures if the automation script is not adapted to handle these changes.

To address the test case failures, the automation script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application. This includes modifying the script to interact with the new elements, updating XPath values, and adjusting the test case flow to accommodate the revised functionality. Additionally, verifying the changes in the application environment and making necessary adjustments in the automation script will help prevent similar failures in the future.

2024-09-16 12:52:49,566:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
According to the error message and the possible reasons for the failure of the test case you provided, it can be concluded that the removal of the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons is the root cause of the failure of the test case.
Looking at the new version of the HTML, I found that there is no "Save Page" or "Save and Close" button, which is consistent with the possible causes of test failure you provided. Instead, I found new elements such as "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete," which are on the same level as the "Add New Page" button.
So, in order to fix this test case, you need to delete the test code of the "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" xpath and change the xpath of the "//*[@id="page_status"]/a" element to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a".
At the same time, based on the understanding of the possible reasons for the failure of the test case, it is necessary to consider whether other elements have been removed in the new version of the HTML. It is found that the "Search Options" element in the test case is no longer in the new version of the HTML, but from the perspective of the test case, this element is not necessary for the test, so it does not need to be tested.

The repaired test case is:

Based on the possible reasons for the test failure, the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons have been removed in the new version of the HTML, and this is indeed the case by searching the new HTML for elements with id "save_and_close" and "save_and_close". This change could cause a test failure, and the original test case does have steps that interact with these two elements.
The error message in the test case indicates that an element cannot be interacted with, and it can be seen from the new version of the HTML that the test case has a step that tries to enter text into an input box and then click on a button. In this context, the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons are the only ones that are likely to trigger this error.
So to fix the test case, you need to delete the steps in the test case that interact with the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons.

The repaired test case is:

According to the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure, I found that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons were indeed not present in the new version of the HTML.
In the new version of the HTML, I didn't find any new element similar to the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons, and the test case is trying to interact with the element with the id "page_title", but according to the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure, the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons are not present in the new version of the HTML, so the subsequent operation cannot be executed, and the test case will report an error.
So the subsequent "Save and Close" and all the test cases related to the root cause of the failure should be removed, such as '//*[@id="save_and_close"]'.
At the same time, understanding the possible reasons for test failure is based on the error message content, and it is also found that the xpath expression in the error message is indeed not consistent with the test case.
So, in order to avoid test case failure in the future, it is also necessary to remove the corresponding test code in the test case according to the understanding of the root cause of the failure.
Based on the new HTML, it can be seen that the id value of the element is "Save and Close", so the xpath in the test case in the error message should be '//*[@id="save_and_close"]'.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")

According to the analysis of the possible reasons for the failure, the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons are missing in the new version, but the error message says that the element cannot be operated on, and the subsequent test cases can be executed, so it is not a problem with these two buttons.
At the same time, by searching the new version of HTML for the xpath in the failed test case, it is found that there is no element with the id "page_title".
So, to fix the test case, you need to remove the test code line with "//*[@id="page_title"]" and change the xpath of the next line of test code, "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a", to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a/span".

Based on the possible reasons for test failure you provided, the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons were not found in the new version of the HTML, but the error message mentions the "interactable element", and there are elements in the new HTML that have similar IDs to the error message.
According to the new version of the HTML, there is no "Save Page" and "Save and Close" button, but there are "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete", "Preview", "Edit", "Delete" buttons, and their ID are "fusion_AHRvJH", "fusion_YlVaFj", "fusion_lKFbFf", "fusion_XlJ4KT", "fusion_YlJaHl", "fusion_hxJLkd" respectively, and the error message says that the error occurred at line X of the test case, which contains a "send_keys" operation, so the root cause of the error is that the line of code tries to enter some text into an element that is not an input box.
By understanding the possible root causes of test failure, we know that to solve this problem, it is necessary to modify the "send_keys" method to a more appropriate operation, such as "click" in this case.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

In the new version of the HTML, there is no "Save Page" or "Save and Close" button, and in order to avoid any possible understanding error, the "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete", "Preview", "Edit", "Delete" button has been found, and the ID of the corresponding element is also listed.
So, for the "Save and Close" part in the test line of code, the original "send_keys" should be changed to "click".
2024-09-16 12:53:43,489:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
By comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify several key differences that may have caused the test case failure with the error message indicating "element not interactable":

1. The "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons have been removed in the new version and replaced with "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" buttons. The absence of the original save buttons could be the root cause of the test case failure since the test case may be trying to interact with elements that no longer exist.

2. The "Enable TINYMCE" button and the corresponding Visual Page Composer textarea have been removed in the new version. If the test case is trying to interact with these elements, it would result in an "element not interactable" error.

3. The "View" button and its corresponding xpath have been removed in the new version. If the test case is trying to click on this element, it would fail due to its absence.

4. The new version introduces a "Search Options" button and related elements like the search input box, status select box, visibility select box, etc. If the test case is not updated to handle these new elements, it may result in failures when trying to interact with them.

5. The error message "element not interactable" typically occurs when Selenium tries to interact with an element that is not visible or not enabled. This could also be due to changes in the structure of the web page or the timing of when the elements become interactable.

In summary, the removal of key elements such as the original save buttons and the introduction of new elements in the new version are likely the root causes of the test case failure. The test case needs to be updated to reflect these changes in the application to ensure successful execution.

2024-09-16 12:53:55,526:INFO:The testcase 2-1 is generated:
Based on the new version of the HTML and error message, we can see that there is a "element not interactable" exception for the element with id "page_title".
At the same time, the test case contains an operation that sends a string "123" to the "page_title" element, and then the error is reported in the next line of code, which is consistent with the error message.
So the "page_title" element can't be interacted with, possibly because it is not visible, or it's readonly or disabled.
But by looking at the new version of the HTML, I can see that the "page_title" element can be interacted with, it is a text input box and does not have any properties such as readonly or disabled, and is not hidden. The xpath of the element is '//*[@id="page_title"]'.

Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the removal of the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons and the introduction of the "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" buttons in the new version is the root cause of the test failure.
At the same time, by looking up the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the "Enable TINYMCE" button and the corresponding Visual Page Composer textarea have not been removed, so it has nothing to do with the test case.
In addition, according to the new version of the HTML, the "View" button has not been removed, so it is not relevant to the test failure.
Also, by looking up the new version of the HTML, it is found that there is no "Search Options" button, and the id of the "status" select box mentioned in the possible causes of test failure is "select2-chosen-1", which is not correct, and its parent element id is "page_status".

So, to fix the test case, you need to replace the xpath of "//*[@id="page_title"]" with "//*[@id="page_title-field"]/div/input", and replace "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" with "//*[@id="page_title-field"]/div/button[contains(text(),"Publish")]". Since the "Publish" button has a sub-item of "Publish and Close", which is similar in function to "Save and Close", it is more appropriate to replace it with "Publish".
In addition, you need to replace "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" with "//*[@id="page_status-field"]/div/div[1]/a" and "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]" with "//*[@id="select2-results-1"]/li[2]".

Based on the error message and the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be inferred that the "Save and Close" button was removed in the new version, and the test case was trying to interact with this element, resulting in an "element not interactable" error. So, the root cause of the failure in this test case was that the "Save and Close" button was removed.
At the same time, you need to pay attention to that the new version of the HTML does not contain the "Enable TINYMCE" button or corresponding elements.
In addition, from the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that there is no "View" button, so this is also one of the reasons for the test failure.
In addition, a new search feature has been introduced, which contains a search input box, a status select box, a visibility select box, etc. This element is not in the test case, so it should not have an impact on the test case.

According to the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons have been removed and replaced with the "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" buttons, and the "Enable TINYMCE" button and the corresponding Visual Page Composer textarea have also been removed.
The "Search Options" button and related elements, like the search input box, the status selection box, the visibility selection box, etc., have been added in the new version of the HTML, which may also lead to test failures.
At the same time, based on the error message, the "element not interactable" is caused by the element is not visible or not enabled, so it is possible that the structure of the new version of the HTML is not the same as the old version, leading to the location of the element has changed.
So, to fix the test case, you need to remove the steps related to the removed elements, such as the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons and the "Enable TINYMCE" button. And, to test the new elements that have been added, like the "Search Options" button, you need to make sure they don't raise an error in the test case.

Based on the new version of the HTML and the test case, it can be concluded that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons have been removed, and the new version does not contain elements with similar text or functions. The root cause of the test failure is the removal of these two buttons, which is consistent with the analysis of the possible causes of test failure.
At the same time, it can be seen that in the new version of the HTML there are no "Enable TINYMCE" buttons and Visual Page Composer text areas with similar functions, which is consistent with the possible causes of test failure you mentioned.
According to the new version of the HTML, there is no "View" button, but there is a "Preview" button, so this is not the root cause of the test failure.
A new "Search Options" button has been added in the new version, which is consistent with the possible causes of test failure you mentioned. In addition, there are "Status", "Visibility", "Author", and other select options, the id is different but the function is similar, you also need to pay attention to in the test case to find the corresponding part to update.
In the new version of the HTML, there is no "Publish", "Unpublish" or "Delete" button, so the test case should not be trying to click on these elements.
In the new version of the HTML, there is no "Enable TINYMCE" button, so the test case should not be trying to click on this element.
In the new version of the HTML, the "View" button has been removed, but a "Preview" button has been added instead, so the test case should not be trying to click on this element.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

The new test case you provided has a bug, the "Save and Close" button was removed in the new version of HTML, so the corresponding test code line in the test case should be removed.
2024-09-16 12:55:35,450:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the key changes are:

1. In the old version, there were elements related to saving and canceling actions, such as "Save Page," "Save and Close," "Cancel," and "Enable TINYMCE." These elements are not present in the new version. The absence of these elements indicates that the workflow or functionality related to saving and canceling actions has been redesigned or relocated in the new version. This change is likely the root cause of the test case failure related to interacting with these elements.

2. In the new version, there are elements related to adding a new page ("Add New Page"), publishing ("Publish"), unpublishing ("Unpublish"), and deleting ("Delete"). These elements were not present in the old version. The introduction of these new elements indicates a shift in the user interface and functionality related to managing pages.

3. The error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable" suggests that the test case failed due to an inability to interact with an element. This could be due to various reasons such as element visibility, element state (e.g., disabled), element positioning, or changes in the DOM structure.

4. The new version also includes elements like search input box, search options toggle, status select box, visibility select box, category select box, language select box, author select box, etc., which were not present in the old version. These additional elements may have caused changes in the overall page structure or layout, affecting the test case execution.

In summary, the main reasons for the test case failure are likely the removal of elements related to saving and canceling actions from the old version and the introduction of new elements in the new version. These changes have impacted the workflow and interaction points of the test case, leading to the ElementNotInteractableException error. To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to interact with the new elements and adjust the workflow according to the changes in the application's UI and functionality.

By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure and comparing the possible causes of failure with the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that the removal of the "Save Page," "Save and Close," "Cancel," and "Enable TINYMCE" elements and the introduction of the "Add New Page," "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" elements are consistent with the new version of the HTML.
In addition, from the error message "ElementNotInteractableException" you can see that the error is related to not being able to interact with the element. By checking the new version of the HTML, it can be found that some of the possible new elements are actually in the form of dropdown boxes, and the error message is consistent with the situation that the dropdown box is not expanded and cannot be selected.
So, to fix the test case, you need to add code to click on the "Page" tab, and then click on the "Add New Page" button to open the page for adding new pages.
The original test case line of code with the highest XPath and the error message is similar to "//*[@id="page_title"]", which is actually a <input> tag, so you need to be more careful when checking the XPath.
Based on the new version of the HTML, it can be inferred that the root cause of the test failure is that the test case tried to enter some text into the element (with id "page_title"), but before that, the test case did not open the "Add New Page" panel, so the element was not visible in the DOM structure and therefore could not be interacted with. The same is true for the following select boxes.
So, in order to fix the test case, the xpath that finds the "Add New Page" element needs to be found, and a click operation is added before the test case line of code that enters the text.
Also, to prevent future ElementNotInteractableException errors, the test code line that contains the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]" should be removed, and the line of code that enters the text should be moved to the end of the test case.

Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for the failure of the test, it is known that the "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", "Enable TINYMCE" and other elements in the old version have been removed in the new version, and the "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete" and other new elements have been added. Therefore, in order to fix the error of the test, you need to remove the related lines of code in the test case and then add the "Add New Page" element to the test case to execute.
At the same time, by observing the new HTML source code, it can be seen that there is no "Enable TINYMCE" element, which is consistent with the "possible test intent" mentioned in the test case analysis, and it can be confirmed that the new version of the HTML source code is the one mentioned in the test error message.
In addition, by looking at the new HTML, it can be found that the id value of the element with the status select box is "s2id_page_status", which is consistent with the error message, so in order to fix this error, you need to replace "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" in the test case with "//*[@id="page_status-field"]".

Based on the possible causes of test failure and the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that the root cause of the failure of this test case is the change of the element related to the save and cancel actions. At the same time, there are new elements in the new version of the HTML related to "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete" and other actions.
To fix the test case, just delete the lines of code related to the old version of the element, such as "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", "Enable TINYMCE", etc., and add code to interact with the new version of the element.
For the reported error message, "ElementNotInteractableException" is reported. According to the new version of the HTML and the xpath in the test case, the root cause of the error is because the test case was trying to click the element with the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]", but in the new version of the HTML, this element is not found. However, by looking up the xpath in the test case, we can find that there is a highly similar element with the xpath "//*[@id="cp_filter"]/div[1]/button[2]", which is most likely the root cause of the error.
In order to fix the reported error and ensure that the original test case can be run, the test line of code with the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" should be replaced with the test line of code with the xpath "//*[@id="cp_filter"]/div[1]/button[2]".

Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, the root cause of the test failure is that there is no longer an "Add New Page" element in the new version of the HTML, which has led to the subsequent test steps not being able to be executed.
At the same time, according to the new version of the HTML, I found that there are elements with similar names like "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" in the new version, and the "Enable TINYMCE" element has also been removed. These new elements can be found in the new version of the test case, so it can be inferred that this is a change that has been made in the new version, but it is not relevant to this test case.
The test case mentioned in the possible cause of failure report is not related to the test case mentioned in the error message, so it can be ignored.

In the test case, the xpath of the "Save Page" element does not exist in the new version of the HTML, so it should be removed from the test case.
In the test case, "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" should be replaced with "//*[@id="page_title-append-btn"]" to interact with a valid element in the new version of the HTML.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title-append-btn"]').click()
...

In this case, the original test case failed because the element could not be interacted with, and by understanding the new version of the HTML, it can be inferred that the root cause of the failure is that the "Add New Page" element does not exist.
2024-09-16 12:55:48,356:INFO:The testcase 3-5 is generated:
Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the root cause of the test failure is the removal of the "Save Page," "Save and Close," "Cancel," "Enable TINYMCE" and other elements, and the test case reported an ElementNotInteractableException error, which can be understood as the test code wants to interact with these missing elements.
At the same time, it can be seen from the new version of the HTML that there is an element with an id of "page_title" on the page, which is very similar to the one mentioned in the error message, so it is likely that this is the element that caused the error in the test case.
In addition, it can be seen that in the new version of the HTML, there are also elements with the id "Publish", "Unpublish" and "Delete", and the structure of these elements is consistent with the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, so the removal of the "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel" and other elements is likely to be replaced by these elements.
So to fix this test case, all you need to do is remove lines that contain "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" and "//*[@id="admin_password"]", and replace "//*[@id="page_title"]" with "//*[@id="page_title-field"]/input", and "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" with "//*[@id="page_status-field"]/div[1]/div[2]/a".
In addition, based on the understanding of the test case code, it can be inferred that the intent of the test is to add a new page, set the page title, select the page status, and then save and close the operation.
So in the new test case, you also need to add test code to click on the "Add New Page" button and the "Publish" button.
2024-09-16 12:56:32,368:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that significant changes have been made in the new version. The first element removed from the old version is the "Save Page" button, which is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Root Cause:
1. **Element Removal:** The "Save Page" button (xpath="//*[@id="save-btn"]") from the old version is missing in the new version. This removal directly affects any test case that interacts with this button, leading to the "ElementNotInteractableException" error message.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. **Element Replacement:** The new version introduces entirely new elements such as the search input box, "Add New Page" button, "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" buttons, among others. Test cases that rely on these elements from the old version will fail as they no longer exist or have been replaced.
   
2. **Element Position Change:** Elements such as "Save and Close," "Cancel," and "Enable TINYMCE" have been removed or their positions altered. Test cases relying on specific element positions or sequences will fail due to these changes.
   
3. **Element Attribute Changes:** The new version introduces select boxes with different xpaths for status, visibility, category, language, and author. Test cases that interact with these elements using specific xpaths from the old version will fail due to the attribute changes.
   
4. **Possible Functionality Changes:** The addition of elements like "Search Options," "Clear," and the toggle for search options may indicate changes in the application's functionality. Test cases that do not account for these new features may fail due to unexpected behavior.

In conclusion, the removal of the "Save Page" button and the introduction of new elements, along with changes in element positions and attributes, are the main reasons for the test case failure. Updating the test cases to reflect the changes in the new version's elements and functionalities is necessary to address these failures.

The analysis of the possible causes of test failure mentions that the "Save Page" button has been removed in the new version, and based on the information in the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" does not exist, which is consistent with the error message. Therefore, the "Save Page" button has been removed, which is the root cause of the test case failure. The "Save Page" button in the old version is called "Save Page" and is a sibling of the "Save and Close" button in the new version, so it can be inferred that the "Save Page" button is the same as the "Save and Close" button.
At the same time, the new version of the HTML has a new "Add New Page" button, and test cases that interact with this button in the old version will fail, which is consistent with the "Element Replacement" described in the analysis.
In addition, it can be found that the "Cancel" button mentioned in the analysis can not be found in the new version of the HTML, which indicates that the test case that interacts with the "Cancel" button will fail.
And the xpath "//*[@id="admin_password"]" in the test case can not be found in the new version of the HTML, but from the description of the possible test failure root cause analysis, it can be seen that there is a "Admin Password Reset" option in the new version of the HTML, so it can be inferred that the two may be related. To verify this inference, we can look up the xpath of the "Admin Password Reset" option in the new version of the HTML and see if it is the same as the xpath in the error message.
There are also the "Enable TINYMCE" and "Search Options" buttons, which can be found in the new version of the HTML, and the xpaths are "//*[@id="toggle_options"]" and "//*[@id="page_clear"]" respectively.
To address the test intent of the original test case, the "Add New Page" and "Save Page" buttons must be added back to the test case, and the test cases related to the "Cancel" button need to be deleted.
At the same time, to ensure that the subsequent test steps can be executed normally, the xpath "//*[@id="admin_password"]" should be changed to "//*[@id="page_title"]".
In addition, the xpaths in the test case that correspond to the "Enable TINYMCE" and "Search Options" buttons need to be changed to the xpaths found in the new version of the HTML.
Finally, according to the new version of the HTML, there is no "Save and Close" button, but in order to ensure that the root cause of the error can be fixed, the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" in the test case should be changed to "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" and then be removed.

At the same time, other new elements are mentioned in the analysis, such as search boxes and "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" buttons. The test case uses a new "Publish" button.
The test case mentioned in the error message is about not being able to interact with the element, and the "Save Page" button was changed to "Publish" in the new version, so it is likely that the element with id "save_and_close" in the test case was changed to "Publish".

By finding the element with the id "save_and_close" in the new version of the HTML, it can be found that it is very similar to the "Save Page" button in the test case, and is most likely the new version of the "Save Page" button.
So to fix the test case, you only need to change the xpath of "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" to "//*[@id="save-btn"]".
At the same time, to prevent the test case from failing due to the "Save Page" button not being found, the subsequent test steps for adding and modifying page content in the test case should also be deleted, because in the new version of the HTML, the "Add New Page" and "Edit" buttons appear to be contained in the table for listing page content, while the test step after the "Save Page" button is found in the form for adding and modifying the page.

By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it is known that the "Save Page" button is not the root cause of the problem, but the test case still has an operation on the "Save Page" button, which is one of the reasons for test failure.
At the same time, by understanding the error message and the new HTML, it can be seen that some elements mentioned in the error message can be found in the new HTML and have xpath matching the error message, which is the root cause of the "ElementNotInteractableException" error.
The "Save and Close" button (xpath="//*[@id="save_and_close"]") is very similar in name and functionality to the "Save Page" button, and their xpaths are very close, which may cause a misunderstanding and lead to a wrong judgement as to the root cause.
In addition, the new version of the HTML contains a "<form>" tag that was not found in the old version of the test case, so the xpath in the test case that includes the "<form>" tag will have to be modified.
By understanding the possible causes of test failure and reading the new HTML, it can be seen that the "Save Page" button has been replaced by the "Add New Page" button in the new version of the HTML, and as a result, the "Save and Close" button will have to be removed from the test case.
In addition, by observing the changes in the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that new elements, such as "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete," are in the same parent-child relationship as the "Add New Page" button, and there is a high probability that the "Save Page" button in the old version will be replaced by a combination of these three buttons, so in the new test case, the operation on the "Save Page" button should be replaced by the operation on the "Publish" button.
Furthermore, from the analysis of possible test failure reasons, it can be seen that the <form> tag in the new version of HTML may have led to changes in the xpaths of related elements. By understanding the new HTML, it can be seen that this change does exist, for example, the "Save and Close" button has been moved into the <form> tag, so in order to keep the operation on the element, it needs to add "/form" to the xpath.
In order to fix the root cause of the problem reported by the error message, you need to find and change the xpath of the test case in the new test case so that it no longer matches the xpath of the new HTML element with the same id.
According to the new HTML, the xpath of the "Save and Close" button is '//*[@id="save_and_close"]', but the error message indicates that the xpath is '//*[@id="save_and_close"]', which means that the test case has an error in it, so you need to change it to '//*[@id="save_and_close"]' to fix the error.
At the same time, by understanding the error message and reading the new HTML, it can be found that the xpath of the element that triggers the error is very similar to the xpath of the "Save and Close" button, and the element has the id "save_and_close", so the xpath in the test case should be modified to '//*[@id="save_and_close"]'.
At the same time, to ensure that the reported error can be fixed and that the test case can be run without any errors, it is necessary to understand the subsequent test steps. By looking at the new HTML, you can find out that there is no element with the id "page_title", which is included in the subsequent test steps. As a result, all the subsequent test steps are based on the element that triggered the error, "Save and Close", and are not relevant to the root cause of the error, so there is no need to make any changes to them.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...
The possible root cause of the error was understood to be the removal of the "Save Page" button, and the root cause was judged to be the element of the same id as the reported error.
In the subsequent analysis of possible reasons for test failure, it was mentioned that there was a misunderstanding that the "Save Page" button was the root cause, and this misunderstanding was confirmed by understanding the new HTML to be incorrect.
By examining the error message and new HTML, it can be seen that the xpath of the reported error is very similar to the xpath of the "Save Page" button, and in fact has the same id as the "Save and Close" button.
So in order to fix the error, you have to first change the xpath of the "Save and Close" button in the test case, and then consider changing the xpath of the test case that triggers the error in order to prevent it from happening again in the future.
In this way, the root cause of the error can be fixed, and the subsequent steps of the test case can be continued to run successfully.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...
2024-09-16 12:56:48,665:INFO:The testcase 4-5 is generated:
Based on the analysis of possible test failures, we can see that the "Save Page" button was removed in the new version, but in fact, it is not relevant to this test case, because the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" is not found in the test case. So, this analysis is wrong.
By analyzing the error message and the new version of HTML, we can find that the error is caused by the inability to interact with the element, and the xpath in the test case is very similar to the one in the error message, which is "//*[@id="admin_password"]".
Based on the new version of the HTML, we can find that the xpath "//*[@id="admin_password"]" does not exist, which means that the element has been removed in the new version, and according to the xpath's understanding, the element is likely to be a password input box.

The repaired test case is:

Based on the provided information, the main elements that were present in the old version but are missing in the new version are as follows:

1. "Save Page" xpath="//*[@id="save-btn"]"
2. "Save and Close" xpath="//*[@id="save-close-btn"]"
3. "Cancel" xpath="//*[@id="cancel"]"
4. "View" xpath="//*[@id="tab-content-composer_tab"]/div[1]/a"
5. "Enable TINYMCE" xpath="//*[@id="tinymce_switch"]"
6. (Visual Page Composer textarea) xpath="//*[@id="tinymce"]"
7. "Save" xpath="//*[@id="save"]"
8. "Save and Close" xpath="//*[@id="save_and_close"]"

The error message indicates an ElementNotInteractableException, which means that Selenium was not able to interact with an element on the web page. The first element that was removed in the new version, "Save Page" xpath="//*[@id="save-btn"]", is most likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Possible reasons for the test case failure:
1. **Element not present:** The "Save Page" button was removed from the new version, causing Selenium to fail when trying to interact with it. This resulted in the ElementNotInteractableException error.

2. **Changes in functionality:** The removal of the "Save Page" button may indicate a change in the workflow or functionality of the web application. The test case that relied on this button would fail due to the missing element.

3. **Updates in the UI:** The new version introduced a completely different set of main elements, indicating a significant UI overhaul. The removal of the "Save Page" button might be part of a larger redesign effort.

4. **XPath changes:** Even if the elements were present in the new version, if their XPaths were modified, Selenium might not be able to locate and interact with them properly, leading to test case failures.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application. Specifically, the interactions related to the "Save Page" functionality need to be revised or replaced with the relevant elements present in the new version. Additionally, any other elements that have been removed or modified should be identified and updated in the test scripts accordingly.

2024-09-16 12:57:33,077:INFO:The testcase 5-1 is generated:
Based on the possible causes of test failure you provided, there is no "Save Page" button in the new version of the HTML. But according to the xpath of the test case and the new HTML, there is a "Save Page" button in the new version of the HTML.
At the same time, according to the new HTML, the xpath of the "Save and Close" and "Cancel" elements has been changed, and the "Save and Close" element can be found in the new HTML.
In addition, according to the understanding of the test case and the new HTML, the "View", "Enable TINYMCE", (Visual Page Composer textarea), "Save" elements do not exist in the new version of the HTML.
But after reading the test case, I found that the test code for the "Save Page" element uses a click operation, and the error message is for a non-interactable element, so it is not the root cause of the test failure.
However, the xpath in the error message is consistent with the "Save and Close" element in the new version of the HTML, and the error is that the element is not interactable, and the original test case also contains a line of code to click on a "Save and Close" element, so it is likely that the "Save and Close" element in the new version of the HTML is not visible, disabled or of the wrong type.
If the root cause of the test failure can be found in the error message, then by understanding the new HTML, it can be found that the xpath of the "Save and Close" element has changed, but the xpath in the test case in the error message is still consistent.
It can be inferred that, in fact, the root cause of the test failure is that the "Save and Close" element in the new version of the HTML is not visible, disabled or of the wrong type.
By understanding the new HTML, it can be found that the "Cancel", "View", "Enable TINYMCE", "Save" elements do not exist in the new version of the HTML, but the test case does not report any exceptions for these elements, which means that the test did not reach this step and did not attempt to interact with these elements.
According to the new HTML, the xpath of the "Save and Close" element is "//*[@id="save_and_close"]", which is consistent with the line of code in the test case that contains a click operation.
So, to fix the test case, you just need to delete the line of code that contains the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" element, and there is no need to change the xpath in the test case to any other string.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
# driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

2024-09-16 12:57:33,078:INFO:The testcase 5-2 is generated:
In the new version of the HTML, there is no element with the id "Save Page", "Save and Close", and "Cancel", nor any element similar to it, so they are not the root cause of the test case failure.
At the same time, the new HTML does not contain an element with the id of "View" and "Enable TINYMCE", so it is not the root cause of the test case failure.
The new HTML has an element with the id "Save and Close", so it is consistent with the possible reasons you mentioned. But the xpath is different.
Also, there is no "Save" element with id in the new version of the HTML, but there is a "Save" button, which has the same function.
So, to fix the test case, you need to change "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" to "//*[@id="save-close-btn"]" and "//*[@id="save"]" to "//*[@id="save-btn"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save-btn"]').click()
# sleep(1)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save-close-btn"]').click()
...

In addition, if the test intent includes the detection of these elements, it should be added to the new test case to detect whether they have been removed or changed in the new version of the HTML.
2024-09-16 12:57:33,078:INFO:The testcase 5-3 is generated:
In order to fix the test case, you need to locate the "Save Page" element first and then check for any possible alternatives to the element and then update the test case to remove the relevant test code.
By searching the new version of the HTML for the "Save Page" element, it can be found that there is no such element in the new version, which matches the analysis of the possible causes of test failure.
By further analyzing the list of possible root causes of test failure, it can be found that there is only one element whose xpath is similar to "Save Page" and it is "Save and Close" in the new version of the HTML, whose xpath is "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".
By analyzing the test case and the new HTML, it can be found that the "Save and Close" element is still present in the new version of the HTML, which means that the element was not removed, but it may have been renamed or its internal logic may have been changed.
By analyzing the test case, it is easy to find out that the root cause of the failure of the test case is the subsequent line of code, "driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()", which is attempting to interact with the "Save and Close" element, and by understanding the meaning of the test case, it can be inferred that this line of code is trying to save the changes on the page and close the current page.
So, in order to fix the test case, all you have to do is change the "Save Page" in the test case to "Save and Close".

By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it can be known that the "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel" elements are not present in the new version of the HTML, and according to the new version of the HTML, there is no such element.
Based on the new version of the HTML, you can find that the <button> tag with the xpath of "//*[@id="save-close-btn"]" no longer exists, which means that the root cause of the test failure is the "Save and Close" button.
At the same time, it can be found in the new HTML that there is no <a> tag with a "View" xpath of "//*[@id="tab-content-composer_tab"]/div[1]/a", no <a> tag with a "Enable TINYMCE" xpath of "//*[@id="tinymce_switch"]", and no <textarea> tag with a "Visual Page Composer" xpath of "//*[@id="tinymce"]", but there are corresponding new elements in the new HTML, so it is likely that the functions of these elements have been updated or replaced in the new version, but they still have some impact on the test cases, which should be noted.
There is no <button> tag with the xpath of "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" in the new version of the HTML, but there is a "Save and Close" button, which is consistent with the possible reasons for test failure.
According to the new version of the HTML, the "Cancel" button is still present and can be found to have a <button> tag with the xpath "//*[@id="cancel"]".
By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it can be known that there is a "Save" and a "Save and Close" element in the original test case, but there is only one "Save and Close" element in the new version of the HTML, so it can be understood that the "Save" and "Save and Close" are the same element, but it has two different xpath expressions.
Similarly, by understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it can be known that there is a "Save and Close" and a "Save and Close" element in the original test case, but according to the new version of the HTML, there is only one "Save and Close" element in the new version of the HTML, so it can be understood that these two elements are the same.
According to the error message, the error occurred when trying to interact with an element, and the last xpath in the test case that was consistent with the error message was "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".
So, by understanding the possible reasons for test failure and analyzing the error message, we can know that the "Save and Close" element is the root cause of the test failure.
At the same time, in order to avoid similar test failures in the future, it is necessary to remove or modify the test cases in the new version of the test code that may have a similar impact on the test results.
In addition, according to the new version of the HTML, the "Enable TINYMCE" element is actually a <label> tag, and it has a "for" attribute, the value of which is "tinymce_switch", so it can be understood that the corresponding element in the new version of the HTML is a <input> tag with the id of "tinymce_switch".
Similarly, it can be understood that the "View" element in the new version of the HTML is actually a <a> tag, and it has a parent <div> tag, so it can be used to locate the element using the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-cpa"]/div[1]/a".
According to the new version of the HTML, you can find that there is a <button> tag with the id of "save", and according to the test case, the "Save" and "Save and Close" are the same, so the "Save" element should be a <button> tag, and its xpath is "//*[@id="save"]".
At the same time, there is a <button> tag with the id of "save-close" in the new version of the HTML, which is consistent with the "Save and Close" element in the test case, and its xpath is "//*[@id="save-close"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save"]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save-close"]').click()
...

In addition, in order to avoid test failures caused by changes to the new version of the HTML, the untestable elements, such as "View", "Enable TINYMCE", etc., should also be removed from the test case.
2024-09-16 12:57:33,078:INFO:The testcase 5-5 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, we can conclude that the changes made in the new version of the HTML have a certain degree of impact on the functionality of the "Save and Close" button. However, after careful examination of the new HTML, it was found that there was no element with the id "save_and_close" in the new version of the HTML, and it did not appear to be a main element. Therefore, it can be concluded that the "Save and Close" button is not the root cause of the test failure.
Looking for the "Save Page" element, I found that the new version of the HTML has an element with the id "save-btn", which is exactly the same as the possible cause of test failure, and is a main element.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to replace "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" with "//*[@id="save-btn"]" in the test code.
At the same time, to prevent the subsequent test steps from failing, I recommend deleting all the test code lines that contain "//*[@id="cancel"]", "//*[@id="view"]", "//*[@id="enable_tinymce"]", and "//*[@id="tinymce"]".
If you also want to test the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons, you can add a test case to click on the two buttons in the new version of the HTML.

Based on the provided information, we can compare the major elements of the old and new versions to identify the changes that might have caused the test case failure:

1. "Save Page" and "Save and Close" elements are no longer present in the new version. These elements are replaced by "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" buttons. The absence of the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons could be the root cause of the failure as the test case might be trying to interact with these elements which are no longer available.

2. "Cancel" button from the old version is also missing in the new version. If the test case is interacting with the "Cancel" button, it would fail due to this missing element.

3. "Enable TINYMCE" and "View" elements are not present in the new version. If the test case relies on these elements for any functionality, it would result in a failure.

4. The text area element with xpath "//*[@id="editor_textarea"]" from the old version is not found in the new version. If the test case is trying to interact with this specific text area, it would cause a failure.

5. The "Save" and "Save and Close" buttons in the old version have been replaced by "Publish" and "Save and Close" buttons in the new version. If the test case is trying to click on the old "Save" button, it would fail as the element has changed.

Considering the error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable", it is highly likely that the root cause of the test case failure is due to the missing elements from the old version in the new version. The test case is trying to interact with elements that are no longer available or have been replaced, leading to the "ElementNotInteractableException".

To address this issue, the test case needs to be updated to interact with the new elements present in the updated version of the web application. The test script should be modified to locate and interact with the new elements based on their updated xpaths or identifiers.

2024-09-16 12:59:24,368:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure, we can see that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons were replaced by "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" buttons, while in the new version of the HTML there is a "Publish" button, which corresponds to the information in the possible cause of failure.
In addition, the "Cancel" button, "Enable TINYMCE", and "View" elements are not in the new version of the HTML, so there is no need to mention them.
There is no element with id "editor_textarea" in the new version of the HTML, but there is a "Page Title" text input box.
Based on the new version of the HTML, "Save" and "Save and Close" have been replaced by "Publish" and "Save and Close", and there is no such button in the new version of the HTML as "Save and Close". But there is a "Publish" button, which can be used as a replacement for the "Save" button in the original test case. The "Save and Close" button in the original test case can be replaced with a "Delete" button.
The original test case xpath can be found in the new HTML error message which is "/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/section[2]/div/div/div/form/div/table/tbody/tr/td[6]/a[1]".
According to the new version of the HTML, to test the "123" input, you need to interact with the "Page Title" text box, whose id is "page_title".
In the new version of the HTML, there is no element with id "admin_password".

The updated test case is:

By understanding the possible causes of test failures and analyzing the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" elements are not present in the new version, but rather the "Publish" and "Save and Close" buttons.
It can be seen that there is no such element as "Enable TINYMCE" in the new version of the HTML.
At the same time, there is no "View" element in the new version of the HTML.
There is no element with the id "editor_textarea" in the new version of the HTML.
Through the analysis of the new version of HTML, it can be found that there is no "Cancel" button, but there are "Publish", "Unpublish" and "Delete" buttons.
And the test case contains a "Save and Close" element, which is not mentioned in the error message, but according to the test case logic, it should also be a root cause of the failure.
So to fix the test case, you need to change "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" to "//*[@id="page_title-append-btn"]", change "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]" to "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[3]", and delete "//*[@id="save_page"]" and "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be found that the test case contains the elements "Save Page" and "Save and Close", which cannot be found in the new version of HTML. However, by searching for the new version of HTML, it can be found that these two elements are still present and have the same id.
At the same time, according to the analysis of the possible reasons for the failure, the new version of HTML still contains the "Cancel" button, and the id is exactly the same as in the old version of HTML.
In addition, the elements "Enable TINYMCE" and "View" mentioned in the analysis are not found in the new version of HTML, but there is an element in the new version of HTML that is very similar to "Enable TINYMCE", with id "editor_textarea".
It can also be found in the new HTML that the "Save" and "Save and Close" elements have not been removed, but have been changed to "Publish" and "Save and Close".

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 12:59:24,369:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
The test case reported ElementNotInteractableException, which means that the test code is trying to interact with an element that is not currently in a state that allows interaction (such as a hidden element, a read-only element, etc.). Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, the new version of the HTML content has a "Delete" button, which indicates that the action element of deleting a page still exists.
Also, from the new version of the HTML, it is easy to find that the "Save and Close" button still exists, but the "Save Page" and "Cancel" buttons do not.
At the same time, the new version of the HTML has no "Enable TINYMCE" and "View" elements, and there is no "text area" element with an xpath of "//*[@id="editor_textarea"]".

According to the test case and error message, "element not interactable" is reported at line 14 in the test case, and the xpath of the element in the error message is "//*[@id="page_title"]". By understanding the new HTML source code, we can find that there is a text box at the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]", so it can be determined that the "Save Page" button is not the root cause of the test failure.
In addition, there is a "Select2" element at the same level of <select> as "//*[@id="page_status"]" in the new HTML, so the xpath in the test case that has the id "select2-results-3" is likely to be an error, and I think it should be changed to "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin_password"]').send_keys("root1234")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin-login-form"]/div/div/button').click()

driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

The repaired test case is consistent with the analysis of possible causes of test failure and the understanding of the new HTML source code.
And, based on the understanding of the new HTML source code, it is believed that the "Cancel" button no longer exists, so the "Save and Close" button should have been replaced by the "Save and Close" button, and it does exist.
The understanding of the new HTML source code also suggests that there is no "Enable TINYMCE" and "View" elements, and there is no such element in the repaired test case, so there is no need to make any changes.
In addition, the xpath in the error message is consistent with the repaired test case, which also confirms that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons are not the root cause of the test failure.
2024-09-16 12:59:24,369:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the failure of the test case, it can be determined that in the new version, the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" elements have indeed disappeared, but the new version has the "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish" and "Delete" elements that have similar functions.
There is no "Cancel" button in the new version, which might also cause the test case to fail if it tries to interact with it.
And the error message says "element not interactable", so it is likely that some element is covering the target element, causing the target element to be not visible, so you should check if there is a pop-up window covering the target element in the new version.
In the new version of the HTML you provided, the <h1> element with the id "Page" can be found, but it has no <input> child element, which makes it impossible to determine whether it is the "Page Title" element mentioned in the possible test failure reasons.
There is no <button> element with the id "Save and Close" in the new version of HTML, so it is impossible for the test case to trigger a click on the button with the xpath '//*[@id="save_and_close"]' in the test case.
Similarly, there is no <button> element with the id "Save" in the new version of HTML, so it is impossible for the test case to trigger a click on the button with the xpath '//*[@id="save"]' in the test case.

2024-09-16 13:00:15,176:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the most significant change is the removal of the "Save Page" element from the old version and the introduction of the "Add New Page" element in the new version. This change is likely the root cause of the test case failure as indicated in the error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable."

Root cause analysis:
1. The "Save Page" element (xpath="//*[@id="save-btn"]") from the old version is no longer present in the new version. This means that any test case referencing this element will fail as it is no longer available for interaction.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in element locators: The xpath locators for elements in the new version have changed compared to the old version. Test cases that rely on specific xpath locators from the old version will fail if those elements have been modified or removed in the new version.

2. New functionality: The introduction of new elements such as "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" buttons in the new version can also cause test case failures if the test scripts are not updated to interact with these new elements.

3. Element visibility and interactability: The error message "element not interactable" suggests that the element targeted by the test case is not currently visible or interactive on the webpage. This could be due to changes in the webpage layout or visibility settings of the element in the new version.

4. Potential changes in workflow: The shift from elements related to saving and canceling actions in the old version to elements related to publishing, unpublishing, and deleting in the new version indicates a possible change in the workflow or functionality of the web application. Test cases that do not align with these new workflows may also fail.

To address the test case failures, the test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the elements and functionality of the new version. Specifically, any references to the removed "Save Page" element should be replaced with the appropriate elements from the new version. Additionally, verify and update the xpath locators of other elements that have changed in the new version to ensure the test scripts interact with the correct elements.

2024-09-16 13:00:25,547:INFO:The testcase 2-1 is generated:
The error message indicates that the "element not interactable" exception occurred, and by observing the root cause and the error message, it can be concluded that this is because the element "Save Page" was removed and the test case line of code to click it has been executed, so the exception occurred. So in order to fix this test case, you need to remove the line of code that contains the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".
At the same time, by looking at the new version of the HTML, the "Add New Page" element has been found, which is consistent with the possible root cause of the error mentioned in the analysis.
So in order to avoid similar problems in the future, you need to find all the possible locations of the "Save Page" element in the new version of the HTML and examine the surrounding elements to see if new elements have been introduced or if the interaction with other elements has been significantly changed.

By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the "Save Page" element has been removed and the "Add New Page" element has been added in the new version. By analyzing the error message, it can be inferred that the "Add New Page" element may have the id "add_new_page".
At the same time, it can be inferred that the xpath of the element that triggers the error in the test case is the xpath of the "Save Page" element, which is not in the new version of HTML.
Based on the analysis of the new version of HTML, we can find that there is no element with an id of "Save Page", but there is a "Page" element, which is consistent with the xpath in the test case.
Therefore, to fix the test case, you just need to change the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" to "//*[@id="add_new_page"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")

driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="add_new_page"]').click()
...

The root cause of the test failure is the change in the element, as shown in the error message, and there is a corresponding error in the analysis of the new version of HTML.

The repaired test case is consistent with the original test intent and is based on understanding the possible causes of test failure and the analysis of new HTML.
2024-09-16 13:00:25,547:INFO:The testcase 2-3 is generated:
The "Save Page" element is not present in the new version of the HTML, but it is not part of the test case that failed in the error message.
At the same time, there is no "Add New Page" element in the new version of the HTML, which is described in the possible reasons for test failure you provided, but the test case that failed is the one that tries to enter the page title, and it can be seen from the error message that the error occurs when the test case tries to interact with the "page title" element.
By analogy, the xpath of the "Save Page" element in the old version of the HTML is "//*[@id="save_and_close"]", and the xpath in the new version of the HTML is "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".
And by analogy, the xpath of the "Add New Page" element in the new version of the HTML is "//*[@id="add-page"]".
In addition, it can be seen from the new version of the HTML that there is no element with an id of "admin_password", so this element has likely been removed, and this part of the test case needs to be deleted.
It can also be seen from the new version of the HTML that there is no "Add New Page" element, so it is likely that the "Add New Page" element is not introduced by the new version of the HTML.
At the same time, the xpath of the "Preview", "Edit", and "Delete" elements in the new version of the HTML is different from the xpath in the test case, which is likely to be the root cause of the error in the test case.
So, to fix the test case, remove the xpath in the test case that matches the "admin_password", and change "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" to "//*[@id="add-page"]".

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 13:00:25,547:INFO:The testcase 2-4 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it can be seen that the introduction of the "Add New Page" element and the removal of the "Save Page" element are the most likely reasons for the test failure.
By understanding the error message and analyzing the new version of the HTML, you can see that the id of the "Save and Close" button has changed, and it is likely that the id of other element in the same area has also changed. In the new version of the HTML, there is no "Save Page" element, and the "Add New Page" element is in the same position as the original "Save Page" element, and the "Save and Close" button is located next to it, so it can be inferred that the "Save and Close" element is a new version of the "Save Page" element.
By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure and the error message, and by examining the new HTML, it can be found that the root cause of the test failure is the change of the "Save Page" element, and the "Add New Page" element is likely to be the element that causes the subsequent test case to fail.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="add_new_page"]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")

driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

The repaired test case completely removes the action of clicking on the "Save Page" element and replaces it with the action of clicking on the "Add New Page" element, which is more appropriate and consistent with the new version of the HTML. At the same time, the test cases after the reported error are for adding a new page and saving it, so understanding the reported error can help understand the test case and whether it has been affected.
2024-09-16 13:00:25,547:INFO:The testcase 2-5 is generated:
By analyzing the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be seen that the "Save Page" element has been removed in the new version and a new "Add New Page" element has been added.
After confirming the understanding of the new version of the HTML, it was found that the "Add New Page" element has an ID "page-add" and is indeed present in the new version of the HTML, and the test case also includes the corresponding xpath, but the element that is still not found is "Add New Page".
In addition, by understanding the intent of the test, it can be found that the "Save Page" element is a button that is used to save the new page being created, and its removal and the addition of the "Add New Page" element indicates a change in the functionality of the web page.
According to the intent of the test, it can be assumed that the test case is trying to create a new page and save it, and the "Add New Page" and "Save Page" elements are used in this process, but both have changed.
So, to fix the test case, you need to change the "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" xpath to "//*[@id="add-page"]".

Here is the analysis of the root cause and other reasons for the test case failure:

1. **Root Cause - Missing Element "Enable TINYMCE":**
   - The "Enable TINYMCE" element is no longer present in the new version of the web application.
   - This element might have been crucial for the test case to interact with the page or perform certain actions.
   - As this element is missing, any attempt to interact with it in the test case would result in an "ElementNotInteractableException."

2. **Other Possible Reasons for Test Case Failure:**
   - **Element Locators Changed:** The xpath locators of the elements in the new version are completely different from those in the old version. If the test case is using the old xpaths, it will fail to locate the elements in the new version.
   - **Functionality Changes:** The functionality of the web application seems to have been restructured in the new version. The actions performed by the test case might no longer be applicable or valid in the new version.
   - **New Features Introduced:** The new version introduces new elements and features that the test case may not be handling correctly or may not be aware of, leading to failures.
   - **Different Workflow:** The workflow of the application might have changed in the new version, causing the test case to navigate through different paths or perform actions in a different order, resulting in failures.

In conclusion, the removal of the "Enable TINYMCE" element is the root cause of the test case failure, as indicated by the error message. However, other factors such as changes in element locators, functionality, new features, and workflow differences in the new version can also contribute to the test case failures. To address the issue, the test case needs to be updated to accommodate these changes in the new version of the web application.

The removal of the "Enable TINYMCE" element has nothing to do with the root cause of the test case failure.
By analyzing the error message and the new version of the HTML, we can find that there is a select element with a id of "s2id_page_status", which has a pop-up dropdown selection box. When the test case is executed, the drop-down selection box must be clicked to make other operations. But the root cause of the test case failure is the new version of the HTML change of the status of the pop-up selection box, which means that the xpath of the test case for this element cannot be found in the new version of the HTML.
So in order to fix the test case you need to change '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a' in the test case to '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]' to ensure that the element can be found in the new version of the HTML.
At the same time, in order to ensure that the test does not fail in the future, please also change the xpath of '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a' in the subsequent line to '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]'.
It should be noted that there is no "page status" element in the new version of the HTML, and I could not find a similar element. So when updating the test case, the xpath containing "page status" in the error message is not present in the new version of the HTML, nor is there a similar element.

The repaired test case is:

The analysis of the possible reasons for test failure has led to the conclusion that the "Enable TINYMCE" element is missing in the new version, but the xpath "//*[@id="tinymce_switch"]" is not found in the new version of the HTML, which is inconsistent with the error message.
At the same time, the root cause of the test failure was analyzed and it was determined that the removal of the "Enable TINYMCE" element was the root cause of the test failure. By looking at the test case and the new HTML, we can find that the new version of the HTML does have a "Tinymce Switch" element, which is a checkbox input box, not a button.
So to fix the test case, you need to replace the xpath "//*[@id="tinymce_switch"]" with "//*[@id="tinymce_switch"]/input".

Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, it is not appropriate to focus only on the "Enable TINYMCE" element, and from the error message and the test case you can see that the error occurred at the "Send key" operation, it is possible that the new version of the application has made changes to the relevant elements that need to be operated in the test case.
The root cause of the test failure can be inferred from the error message and the test case. Since the "Enable TINYMCE" element is not in the error message and the test case, and the subsequent test actions are still performed, the error is not related to it, so it can be ruled out as a possible cause of test failure.
In the new version of the HTML you provided, there are two elements whose ID contains "page_status", and their structure is similar to the one in the error message. By examining the test case, you can see that in the statement where the error occurred, it is trying to click on an element with xpath "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a", and the error message contains information that this element is not clickable, so it can be inferred that the element with ID "page_status" is the one reported in the error message.
So to fix the test case, you need to change the xpath "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" in the test line where the error occurred to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a[1]", and in the subsequent xpath expressions, change "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]" to "//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[1]".

The repaired test case is:
...

In this repaired test case, the original xpath expressions that appeared in the error message were not found to be present in the new HTML source code, so no changes were made to those xpath expressions.
2024-09-16 13:01:22,843:INFO:The testcase 3-4 is generated:
Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, I found that the xpath in the new test case is completely different from the one in the reported error message, so the root cause cannot be the missing of the "Enable TINYMCE" element.
So, in order to find the true root cause, I looked at the error message and found that the reported error was "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException", which means that an element could not be interacted with, not that it was missing.
So by searching for the error message in the new version of the HTML source code, I found that the xpath "//*[@id="tinymce_switch"]" element does exist, and that it is located on a page in the background settings, while the error occurs in a page in the content management.
This means that the removal of the "Enable TINYMCE" element is not the root cause of the test case failure.
By looking at the new version of the test case and the new version of the HTML, I found that the xpath of the <input> element with id "page_title" in the test case is not unique, and the xpath of the <a> element with id "s2id_page_status" is not unique.
So in the new test case, you need to change "//*[@id="page_title"]" to "//*[@id="page_title"]", and change "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" to "//*[@id="page_status"]".

2024-09-16 13:01:22,843:INFO:The testcase 3-5 is generated:
Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the root cause is the missing "Enable TINYMCE" element. However, it is not found in the new version of the HTML you provided, so it is not possible to determine if it is the root cause.
Looking at the error message, it can be found that the reported error is "ElementNotInteractableException", which means that the element can't be interacted with. So the root cause could be that the element found by the xpath expression in the test case is not visible or not an input control or other controllable type.
To determine the root cause, you need to look for elements that have been removed or changed in the new version of the HTML, as well as elements that have a direct impact on or are related to the reported error.
In addition, by examining the new HTML you provided, you can see that there is a <section> element with the text "Page", which is close to the "Enable TINYMCE" in the old version of the HTML.
This new <section> element contains a "Page" title, which is similar in meaning to "Enable TINYMCE" and is an input element. So the removal of this "Page" title element can be seen as the root cause of the test case failure.
Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for test failure, it can be found that the test case is very likely to have other errors. By comparing the test case with the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the xpath expression "//*[@id="page_title"]" in the test case can still find the element in the new version of the HTML, but it reports an "ElementNotInteractableException" error. So in addition to the root cause, there are other errors in the test case.
In order to fix the test case, the action of line 13 in the test case should be changed from '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")' to '//*[@id="page_title"]').click().
At the same time, based on the test case and error message, the next action of line 14 in the test case may also report an error. So, for the sake of caution, you can add a line of code to the test case, before line 14, which finds the "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" element and clicks on it.
In order to avoid the risk of future errors, it is recommended to use the xpath of the "Enable TINYMCE" element in the test case to search for the corresponding element in the new version of the HTML, and then delete that line of code.
It is worth noting that the reported error message contains a xpath expression that can't find the element, but this xpath expression is not present in the test case, so the error may be caused by a change in the test code.

2024-09-16 13:01:45,693:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Based on the provided information and error message, the main reason for the test case failure is likely due to the removal of the "Save Page" element from the old version to the new version. This removal directly impacted the test case that interacted with the "Save Page" button, leading to the "ElementNotInteractableException" error.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in element locators: The new version has completely different element locators compared to the old version. If the test script was not updated to reflect these changes, it could result in the failure to interact with the new elements.
2. Changes in functionality: The functionality of the web application might have been redesigned or restructured in the new version. If the test case was not updated to accommodate these changes, it could lead to failures when interacting with the elements.
3. Changes in user interface: The layout and structure of the web application might have been altered in the new version, causing the test script to fail due to elements not being located where they were expected.
4. Changes in element properties: The properties or attributes of the elements in the new version might have changed, making them uninteractable or inaccessible for the test script.

To address the test case failure, you will need to update the test script to accommodate the changes in the new version, such as modifying element locators, adjusting interactions with elements, and verifying the functionality against the updated UI design.

According to the new HTML, it can be seen that the "Save Page" button has not been removed, but its element ID has been changed to "save_and_close".
So you just need to update the xpath expression in the test case to "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()

In the new version of the HTML, there is no "admin_password" element that appears in the test case, so it is a good choice to remove the corresponding line of test code.
And by examining the test case and the error message, it can be found that the error occurred when trying to click the "Publish" button, so this is likely the root cause of the failure of the test case.
By analyzing the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that the "Publish" button has a <button> tag with a type attribute value of "button", so it is uninteractable.
To fix the test case, you need to change the type attribute value of the "Publish" button to "submit".

Based on the understanding of the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the "Save Page" element has been removed in the new version of the HTML, and the id value of the "Save and Close" button has been changed from "save_and_close" to "page_save".
At the same time, by looking up the new HTML, it can be seen that there is no element with an id of "admin_password", so it is likely that this element has been removed.
In addition, the error message mentions the "element not interactable", so you need to pay attention to whether the element is blocked by other elements.
So to fix the test case, you need to delete the test step that interacts with the "Save Page" element, change the id value in the test step that interacts with the "Save and Close" button to "page_save", and delete the test step that interacts with the "Admin Password" element.
In addition, it is recommended to add an operation to close any pop-up windows that may block the test target element before the test step that failed.

According to the new version of HTML and the analysis of possible reasons for test failure, it can be inferred that the "Save Page" element in the test case is the "Publish" button in the new version of HTML, which is a <button> tag. So to fix the test case you need to change the xpath '//*[@id="save_and_close"]' in the test case to '//*[@id="cp_filter"]/div[1]/button[2]'.
At the same time, the test case contains a xpath '//*[@id="admin_password"]', which is not found in the new version of HTML, and there is no element with a similar name to be found in the new version of HTML, but based on the xpath '//*[@id="admin_password"]' and the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure, we can infer that this is a kind of element that can be interacted with, so it should be changed to the new version of HTML the nearest id to 'admin_password' is 'page_title' (the new version of HTML id is "page_title", and is the "Edit" button in the same row), which is a <input> tag.
In order to prevent the test case from failing due to the "element not interactable" error again, it is recommended to add a short sleep time before the test step that failed.

By understanding the possible reasons for test failures and analyzing the new HTML, it can be concluded that the "Save Page" element was removed in the new version, which is consistent with the possible causes of the test failure mentioned by the user. However, it can also be observed from the new HTML that a new "Save and Close" element has been added, which is similar to the original "Save Page" element, and it is likely that the root cause of the test failure is the change from "Save Page" to "Save and Close".
Therefore, to fix the test case, you just need to change '//*[@id="save_and_close"]' to '//*[@id="save_and_close"]' in the test code.

Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be seen that the "Save Page" element was removed in the new version and that the root cause of the test failure lies in the inability to interact with the element. Therefore, in order to fix the test case, all the subsequent test operations related to the "Save Page" must be removed.
By understanding the possible causes of test failure and the error message, it can be seen that there are ElementNotInteractableException errors in the operation of the "Select Status" element, so it is necessary to make adjustments to the way the test interacts with the element.
At the same time, in the new version of the HTML you can find that there is no "Save and Close" button in the "Add New Page" form. By comparing the line of code that reported the error in the test case, it can be found that the xpath in the error message is similar to that in the test case, but the element content is not the same. Therefore, it can be inferred that the root cause of the test failure is that the "Save and Close" button was removed from the "Add New Page" form.
In addition, by comparing the test case with the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the xpath expression '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]' does not have any corresponding elements in the new version of the HTML, so the test case should be removed.

Based on the provided information, the first element that was removed in the new version is "Save Page" with xpath "//*[@id="save-btn"]". This element was replaced with a new set of elements related to adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting a page. 

The error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable" indicates that Selenium was unable to interact with an element on the page. This could be due to various reasons such as the element not being present in the DOM, being hidden, disabled, or overlapped by another element.

Analyzing the changes in the major elements between the old and new versions, it is clear that the key actions related to saving a page have been completely replaced with actions related to adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting a page in the new version. The removal of the "Save Page" element and the introduction of new elements could be the root cause of the test case failure.

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the page: The new version might have a different layout or structure which could affect the way elements are located and interacted with.
2. Dynamic elements: The new elements might be dynamically generated or loaded on the page, causing timing issues for Selenium to locate and interact with them.
3. Changes in element properties: The new elements might have different properties or attributes that are causing Selenium to fail to interact with them.

To resolve the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to reflect the changes in the major elements between the old and new versions. The test scripts should be modified to interact with the new elements for actions such as adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting a page in the updated version of the web application. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the test scripts handle any dynamic elements or timing issues that may arise in the new version.

In the new version of the HTML, I could not find any elements with id "save-btn", "add-btn", "publish-btn", "unpublish-btn" and "delete-btn", but I did find a set of elements that could be "add", "publish", "unpublish", and "delete" buttons.
In order to reach the "Save & Close" button, you must first click on the "Save" button (which is not mentioned in the error message, but it is highly likely that the "Save Page" element is related to the "Save" button), so the test script needs to be changed to click on the "Save" button first and then click on the "Save & Close" button.
In addition, by checking the error message against the new HTML, it can be found that the xpath "//*[@id="page_title"]" has a corresponding element in the new HTML, but the xpath "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" has no corresponding element.
So, based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, we can know that the "Save Page" element and the "Save & Close" element have been replaced by a new set of elements, and the new version of the "Page status" element is a <select> tag instead of a clickable <a> tag.
According to the analysis of the error message and the new HTML, the root cause of the test case failure is that the "Save Page" element was removed and replaced by a set of elements that include a button with the id "Save" and a button with the id "Save & Close".
At the same time, the original "Page status" element could not be clicked on, and according to the new HTML it can be seen that it is a <select> tag, so it is understandable that the "ElementNotInteractableException" error would be triggered.

2024-09-16 13:02:25,365:INFO:The testcase 5-2 is generated:
In the possible cause of test failure you provided, the "Save Page" element was found to have a new set of elements, and one of the new elements is "Publish".
By comparing the new version of the HTML source code with the test case, it can be found that the id of the "Publish" element is "publish".
And in the error message, it reports the id of the element that cannot be interacted with as "admin_password".
By comparing the new version of the HTML source code with the test case, you can find that there is no element with an id of "admin_password", but there is an element with an id of "page_title".
So it can be inferred that the "Save Page" element is likely to be replaced by the "Page Title" element in the new version, and that "Publish" element has the closest relationship with the "Page Title" element.
So to fix this test case, the "//*[@id="admin_password"]" in the line of test code should be replaced with "//*[@id="page_title"]".
And the line of test code that contains the element with id "Save Page" and reports an error in the error message should be deleted.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")

Note that this repair is based on the analysis of the possible reasons for the failure you provided.
2024-09-16 13:02:25,365:INFO:The testcase 5-3 is generated:
By analyzing the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that the "Save Page" element has not been deleted, but has been replaced by the "Publish" element, "Unpublish" element, and "Delete" element, which are all inside a form with id "cp_filter".
So the new version of the xpath for the save button could be '//*[@id="cp_filter"]/div[1]/button[1]'.
It can be seen from the test case that the original xpath for the test was '//*[@id="save_and_close"]', so it is more likely to be a "Save & Close" button, and not just a "Save" button.
So, to fix the test case, you need to change the xpath in the test case to '//*[@id="cp_filter"]/div[1]/button[1]'.

In the possible causes of test failure, it is mentioned that the "Save Page" element was replaced by a new set of elements, and in the new version of the HTML, four new buttons have been added. So, the new "Save Page" element should be one of the four new buttons.
In the test case, you can see that after the "Save Page" element there are several clicks and send_keys operations, and the error message is that the element is not interactable, which means that the button cannot be clicked to trigger subsequent events. So you need to find a way to click the button.
According to the test case and the new version of the HTML you can see that the xpath of the four new buttons are: "//*[@id="toggle_options"]", "//*[@id="page_clear"]", "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" and "//*[@id="save_and_stay"]". So the "Save Page" element in the error message should be "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

2024-09-16 13:02:25,365:INFO:The testcase 5-5 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the test case failure, it can be seen that the "Save Page" element has been replaced with a new set of elements. By analyzing the new version of HTML, it can be found that the new set of elements includes "Publish", "Unpublish" and "Delete" buttons, and their xpaths are '//*[@id="tab-content-cpa"]/div/div[1]/button[1]', '//*[@id="tab-content-cpa"]/div/div[1]/button[2]' and '//*[@id="tab-content-cpa"]/div/div[1]/button[3]', respectively.
According to the error message, "element not interactable", it can be inferred that the root cause of the test case failure is that the "Save Page" element in the original test case could not be clicked, which means that it could not be interacted with.
The new test case can be fixed by replacing the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" with one of the new elements: "Publish", "Unpublish", or "Delete".

2024-09-16 13:03:38,398:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Based on the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions, the following changes are noted:
1. In the old version, elements related to saving and canceling pages were present.
2. In the new version, elements related to adding a new page, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages were introduced.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. The error message indicates an ElementNotInteractableException, which typically occurs when an element is present on the page but not interactable (e.g., not visible or disabled).
2. The first element removed from the old version is the "Save Page" button. This element was directly related to saving a page, and its absence in the new version could be the root cause of the test case failure.
3. The new version introduced elements for adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages, which indicates a shift in functionality or workflow.
4. The error message suggests that the test case attempted to interact with an element that was not interactable, which aligns with the removal of the "Save Page" button.
5. The changes in major elements between the old and new versions indicate a significant redesign or restructuring of the page composer functionality, leading to test case failures due to missing or changed elements.

Recommendation:
1. Update the test case to reflect the changes in the new version, including interacting with the new elements for adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages.
2. Verify if the functionality related to saving pages has been replaced or relocated in the new version and update the test case accordingly.
3. Consider revisiting the test case design to ensure it aligns with the current functionality and elements present in the updated web application version.

2024-09-16 13:03:50,527:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
According to the error message and possible causes of failure, it can be seen that the removal of the "Save Page" button is the root cause of the test failure.
At the same time, it can be seen from the new version of the HTML that there is no such id "save_and_close" element, but there is an element with the id "save_and_close" in the old version of the test case, which is consistent with the error message.
At the same time, the new HTML also shows that there is no element with an id of "page_status", but it can be seen that there are multiple similar elements in the form that are used as the status filter, which is also consistent with the error message.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to remove the corresponding line of code for the "Save Page" button and change the id "save_and_close" to "save_and_close" and change the id "page_status" to "s2id_page_status".
The new test case should be:

2024-09-16 13:03:50,527:INFO:The testcase 1-2 is generated:
Based on the new HTML, the "Save Page" button is indeed missing, and new buttons for adding a new page, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages are introduced.
The reported error message does not match any of the xpaths in the test case, but according to the possible reasons for the failure, it is likely that the element with the id "page_title" is not interactable, and according to the new version of the HTML, the "Save Page" element was removed. It can be inferred that the "page_title" element is now uninteractable because the "Save Page" element is no longer present.
In order to fix the test case, you need to delete the line that operates on the "page_title" element and replace it with operations on the new elements in the new version of the HTML.
In addition, according to the new version of the HTML, I found that there is no "Save and Close" element, so in order to prevent future failures, it is recommended to delete that line of code.
At the same time, by analyzing the test case, it can be found that this test case is testing a lot of operations related to the page, and the new version of the HTML also contains a lot of elements related to the page. So in order to avoid future failures, it is necessary to carefully review the test case and understand its test intent, and also analyze the new version of the HTML.
The new version of the HTML also does not contain elements with IDs like "admin_password", so the test case probably did not execute the action to enter the password.
The new version of the HTML has an element with the ID "admin_password_reset", which is very similar to the "admin_password" mentioned in the test case, so in order to avoid future test failures, it is recommended to change the element ID in the test case to "admin_password_reset".

The fixed test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin_password_reset"]').send_keys("root1234")

2024-09-16 13:03:50,527:INFO:The testcase 1-3 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it can be concluded that the removal of the "Save Page" element is the root cause of the failure of the test case, and that the subsequent addition of new elements for adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages is a change that cannot be ignored.
So in order to fix the test case, it is necessary to remove the line of code that interacts with the "Save Page" element and add new test code to interact with the new elements for adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages.
According to the error message, the element that is not interactable is the "page title" element.
The xpath of the "page title" element in the new version of the HTML is '//*[@id="page_title"]', which is not consistent with the xpath in the error message.
According to the analysis of possible reasons for test failure, the possible root cause is the removal of the "Save Page" element. However, the understanding of the subsequent changes is not accurate. In the new HTML, there is no indication of the existence of elements with the ids "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete".
At the same time, by reviewing the new version of the HTML, it can be found that there are no elements with IDs of "admin_password", "admin-login-form" and "save_and_close". This suggests that the test cases in the code prior to line 11 have already failed.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

In the new version of the HTML, the "Save and Close" button can be found, which is more consistent with the test case code.
However, the "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" buttons could not be found. It is very likely that these elements are only displayed after a new page has been added, but I cannot be sure without further investigation.

The repaired test case is not entirely correct because the analysis of the root cause of the test failure is incorrect. The new HTML does not have the "Publish", "Unpublish" and "Delete" elements.
2024-09-16 13:03:50,527:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it can be concluded that the removal of the "Save Page" button has led to changes in the page composition and functionality, and the subsequent introduction of elements related to adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages has also confirmed this.
At the same time, by looking up the error message, we can see that the line of code that reports the error is trying to interact with the "Page Title" element (id="page_title") and cannot do so, so it is likely that this is the root cause of the test failure.
So, to fix this test case, you need to delete the test steps related to saving the page, and change the line of code that tries to interact with the "Page Title" element to a line that sets the value of the "Page Title" to "123".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()

2024-09-16 13:03:50,527:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for test failure, it can be found that the change of the major elements is the root cause of test failure. The new version of the elements related to adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages have been added, while the "Save Page" and "Cancel" buttons have been removed.
So, in order to fix the test case, you need to delete the test steps related to "Save Page" and "Cancel" and add the test steps for the new version of the elements.
In addition, since the error message mentions the interaction exception, in order to avoid similar exceptions, it is necessary to increase the waiting time for the page to load before interacting with the new element.

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 13:04:19,440:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Upon comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify several key differences that may have led to the test case failure:

1. **Save Page vs. Add New Page**: The old version had a "Save Page" button, whereas the new version introduced an "Add New Page" button. This change in functionality could potentially impact the test case if the test script was interacting with the "Save Page" button that no longer exists in the new version.

2. **Save and Close Button**: The old version had a "Save and Close" button, which is missing in the new version. If the test script was expecting this button to be present for a specific action, its absence in the new version could cause the test case to fail.

3. **Cancel Button**: The "Cancel" button from the old version is not present in the new version. If the test script was relying on this button for certain actions, its absence could lead to failure.

4. **Visual Page Composer textarea**: The old version had a specific textarea element for the Visual Page Composer, but it is not present in the new version. If the test script was interacting with this textarea for content editing or validation, its absence could cause issues.

5. **Different action buttons**: The old version had "Publish," "Unpublish," and "Delete" buttons, which are not present in the old version. If the test script was interacting with these buttons, their absence in the new version could lead to failure.

6. **Error Message**: The error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable" indicates that the test script is trying to interact with an element that is not currently accessible or interactable on the page. This could be due to changes in the element's attributes, visibility, or functionality between the old and new versions.

Based on the differences mentioned above, the root cause of the test case failure is likely the removal of the "Save Page" button, as it was the first element removed in the new version. The test script may be trying to interact with this missing element, leading to the ElementNotInteractableException error. Additionally, other elements that have been removed or changed in functionality could also contribute to the test case failure.

To address this issue, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version, including identifying and modifying interactions with the new elements and adjusting the test logic accordingly.

By analyzing the possible reasons for test failure and the new HTML, it can be found that the "Save Page" button mentioned in the possible reasons does not exist in the new HTML, and the "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" buttons mentioned in the possible reasons do not exist either. However, a button with the title "Add New Page" was found in the new HTML, which is likely to be the one that replaced the "Save Page" button.
At the same time, a "Save and Close" button was found in the new HTML, so the statement in the possible cause of test failure that the "Save and Close" button was removed is incorrect.
It is also found that the "Cancel" button does not exist in the new version of the HTML, which may lead to a failure of a test case, if the test code is trying to click on this button.
In addition, the test case has the intention to input "123" into the "Page Title" input box, but according to the new HTML, the "Page Title" input box does not have a default value, so it is not necessary to input data in advance. The same is true for the test code that is trying to select the second item from the drop-down list, as there is only one item in the drop-down list.
The "Publish", "Unpublish" and "Delete" buttons are still present in the new version of the HTML, and there is no "Add New Page" button.
The error message is consistent with the xpath in the test case, so to fix the error you need to change the xpath in the test case.
So, to fix the test case, just change '//*[@id="save_and_close"]' in the test code to '//*[@id="add-new-page"]'.

By understanding the possible causes of test failure and the new HTML content, it can be found that the "Save Page" button has been removed in the new version and instead "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete" and other buttons have been added, and the test case is consistent with this, as the line of code in the test that caused the test to fail tried to interact with the "Save Page" button.
In addition, the test case also tries to interact with a "Save and Close" button, which can also be found in the new HTML content and the error message, but it may not exist in the new version of the HTML, so this part of the test code may also need to be modified.
In addition, the error message also mentions that the element could not be interacted with, which can be understood to mean that the element could not be clicked or entered text, which can be observed in the new HTML code as the element has no text box inside, so the line of code that sends the keys should be deleted.

The repaired test case is:

Based on the understanding of the possible reasons for the test failure, it is found that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons have been removed, which has some impact on the test case.
By looking up the error message and the new HTML, it was found that the element with the id "page_title" had a text area that needed to be interacted with, and the error message contained "element not interactable", which is likely to be the root cause of the error.
In addition, by looking up the new HTML it was found that the "Save and Close" button was still present, so it did not have to be removed.
At the same time, it was found that there was a "Cancel" button in the new HTML, so the removal in the new version is inconsistent with the information you provided.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")

driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="add_and_close"]').click()
...

The repaired test case has changed the "Save and Close" to "Add and Close" in order to be consistent with the new version of the HTML. At the same time, the subsequent xpath expression in the test case was also changed, because in the new version of the HTML, the "Save and Close" button was not removed, so it would not have a direct impact on the subsequent test code.
Additionally, in the error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable", the xpath expression of the element was not found in the new HTML, which is likely to be a typo in the error message. By searching the new HTML, it was found that there was a "Cancel" button, whose xpath expression is '//*[@id="add_and_close"]'.
2024-09-16 13:04:31,111:INFO:The testcase 2-4 is generated:
According to the new version of the HTML, the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons have been removed, and new "Add New Page", "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete" buttons have been added.
Based on the analysis of possible test failure causes, it can be found that the new version of the HTML added a "Visual Page Composer" textarea and "Publish", "Unpublish", "Delete" buttons, while the error message is "ElementNotInteractableException", which indicates that the error is likely to be caused by trying to click or input data into an element that cannot be interacted with.
By examining the test case and the error message, it is not difficult to find that the element mentioned in the error message and the xpath are similar to those in the test case, so it can be judged that the error occurred in this statement: driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123").
So to fix the test case, you need to change "//*[@id="page_title"]" to "//*[@id="page_title"]" to make it interact with the Visual Page Composer textarea element, and you can change the test input data to "123" so that it is consistent with the new version of the HTML.
In addition, you need to change the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" in the test case to "//*[@id="Add New Page"]" to make it interact with the "Add New Page" button.
At the same time, the "Delete" button, which was not mentioned in the test case, is also removed, so in order to avoid the test case failing, you need to change the xpath "//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/a" to "//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/a", and change "//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/ul/li[2]/a" to "//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/ul/li[2]/a[2]".

By comparing the possible causes of test failure with the new HTML, we can see that the "Save Page" and "Save and Close" buttons in the old version have indeed been removed, but the "Add New Page" button has been added. This not only indicates that the possible cause of test failure is not due to the removal of the "Add New Page" button, but also suggests that the test case may be creating a new page as an action.
In addition, the new version of HTML does not contain any elements with "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" button types, nor are there any elements that match the xpath expression in the test case that have a similar meaning.
At the same time, in the new version of the HTML, the id of the text box to enter the page title has been changed, the id of the status selector has been changed, and the elements related to the status selector have been changed, and the reported error message contains information about the "Page Title" text box, so it can be inferred that the error occurred when trying to interact with the "Page Title" text box or the status selector element.
According to the understanding of the possible causes of test failure, the test failed because the "Save and Close" button and the "Cancel" button were removed, which can be understood as a change in the overall behavior of the page, leading to the failure of the test case.
So, to fix the test case, you need to delete the line of code that tests the "Save and Close" button and replace it with the line of code that tests the "Add New Page" button.
At the same time, you need to change the xpath in the line of code that tests the "Page Title" text box to "//*[@id="page_title"]" and the xpath in the line of code that tests the status selector to "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a".

2024-09-16 13:04:46,247:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, it is evident that the elements related to saving and canceling actions have been removed and replaced with new elements related to adding, publishing, unpublishing, and deleting pages. 

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable" indicates that the test case failed because the test script was trying to interact with an element that was not visible or enabled on the new version of the web application. 

Most Likely Root Cause:
The first element "Save Page" with xpath="//*[@id="save-btn"]" from the old version was removed in the new version. This removal is likely the root cause of the test case failure as the script would have been interacting with this element for saving actions.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Element Identification: The test script might be trying to interact with elements using xpath values that have changed or are no longer valid in the new version, causing the failure.
2. Functionality Changes: The functionality related to saving and closing pages seems to have been revamped in the new version, leading to the removal of old elements and introduction of new elements. The test script needs to be updated to align with these changes.
3. Test Data: If the test data being used in the script is no longer valid in the new version, it could also lead to test case failures.

Recommendation:
To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new element locators and functionalities of the new version. Additionally, the test data should be reviewed to ensure it is still relevant for testing in the updated version of the web application.

By understanding the new HTML and the error message, it can be concluded that the root cause of the test failure is that the test script attempts to interact with the "Save" and "Save and Close" buttons in the new version of the application but cannot.
From the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, we can know that the functionality related to saving and closing pages has been changed in the new version, so the "Save Page" and "Cancel" buttons have been removed and replaced with the "Publish", "Unpublish" and "Delete" buttons.
At the same time, it can be found in the new version of HTML that the "Save and Close" button has an id of "save_and_close", and its xpath is "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

2024-09-16 13:04:57,930:INFO:The testcase 3-2 is generated:
The possible reasons for test case failure you provided suggest that the major changes in the new version of the web application are related to the actions of saving and canceling, so in order to find out the root cause of the test case failure, I searched for the new version of the HTML and found that the "Save Page" element does not exist, and at the same time found that the "Publish", "Unpublish", and "Delete" elements are present and have a relationship with the new version of the test case.
By examining the new version of the HTML, I could see that the "Save and Close" and "Cancel" elements in the test case could not be found, but instead I found new "Save" and "Close" elements.
At the same time, the error message indicates that the element being reported is not interactive, which means that the element could not be found by the test code, so to fix the test case, you need to remove the interaction with the element that cannot be found and find an alternative element for the new version.
Based on the error message and the analysis of the possible reasons for the failure of the test case, it can be judged that the new version of the test case is very likely to contain the operation of "Save" on the page, which is very likely to cause the error of "element not interactable" in the subsequent line of code.
At the same time, I also found that the "Delete" element has a new id in the new version of the HTML, but the error message does not mention it, so the test case may have been fixed before it reached the line of code.
At the same time, the "Save and Close" and "Cancel" elements in the new HTML source code have the same parent element, so they are likely to be functions that are often used in pairs, and the corresponding new "Save" and "Close" elements can be found together in the new version of the HTML.
So if you want to fix the test case, you need to delete the line of code that interacts with the "Save and Close" element, and find the xpath of the "Save" element in the new version of the HTML and use that to replace it in the test case. You also need to change the xpath of the "Cancel" element in the test case to the xpath of the "Close" element in the new version of the HTML source code.
By looking up the new version of the HTML source code, I found that there is no "page_status" element with id "page_status" and a <select> tag, but there is a <div> element with a class name of "select2-chosen-1" and a <select> tag inside it, and the xpath is "//*[@id="page_status-field"]/div[1]/select".
So, you need to replace the xpath "//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a" in the test case with "//*[@id="page_status-field"]/div[1]/select" in order to test the new "Page Status" element in the new version of the HTML.
Also, the xpath in the error message is similar to the one in the test case, but it has no semantic relationship with the test intent, so it can be ignored.

The repaired test case is:

By understanding the test case, it can be seen that the original intention is to test the "Save Page" element, which was removed in the new version, but in order to test it, the test case needs to first click on an item in the table to enter the sub-page.
At the same time, the error message in the new version of HTML contains "element not interactable" and xpath="//*[@id="page_title"]", so it can be inferred that the test case is likely to fail because the "Save Page" element has been removed and the test case tried to interact with it, resulting in the inability to interact with the subsequent element.
At the same time, in order to ensure that the repaired test case does not generate a new inconsistency with the error message in the new version of the HTML, it is necessary to find an xpath locator in the test case that contains "//*[@id="page_title"]" and is not consistent with it.
After finding in the test case, it is found that there is a locator "//*[@id="page_title"]" that is highly similar to "//*[@id="page_title"]" in the new version of the HTML, and it is likely to be the root cause of the error message in the new version of the HTML.

By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that some elements related to saving and closing have been removed and replaced with new elements related to adding, publishing, and unpublishing pages. By observing the new HTML, it can be seen that the "Save Page" element is indeed not found, and the "Publish" element, "Unpublish" element, and "Delete" element were found, which is consistent with the possible cause of failure mentioned in the error message.
Therefore, the "Save Page" is probably not directly removed, but it may be integrated into other functions like "Add New Page".
At the same time, it can be found in the new HTML that the id of the "Save and Close" button is "save_and_close", which is consistent with the new version of the test case, and there is no change in the "Cancel" button.
So the test case may only need to be updated with xpath as "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save_and_close"]').click()
...

In this repaired test case, the xpath in the test code segment is consistent with the information in the error message, but it is not consistent with the context of the test code segment.
The repaired xpath is "//*[@id="save_and_close"]", and its corresponding element is the "Save and Close" button, which is consistent with the context of the test code segment.
The original xpath in the test case is "//*[@id="save-btn"]", which is consistent with the new version of the HTML.
So there is no need to change the xpath of the subsequent code of the repaired test case.
2024-09-16 13:05:14,995:INFO:Cause of failure 4 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the key elements related to saving functionality have been removed in the new version. Specifically, the elements "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", "Save", and "Save and Close" are no longer present in the new version. This removal of critical elements related to saving actions is likely the root cause of the test case failure with the error message "element not interactable".

Possible reasons for the test case failure:
1. Missing save functionality elements: The removal of elements related to saving actions in the new version could lead to the inability to interact with these elements during the test case execution, resulting in the "ElementNotInteractableException" error message.

2. Changes in the application flow: The introduction of new elements and changes in the application flow might have affected the sequence of actions in the test case, causing it to fail due to elements being in different locations or not available.

3. Changes in element properties: The properties of the remaining elements might have been altered in the new version, making them unrecognizable or interactable by the test script.

4. Incompatibility with test scripts: The test scripts written for the old version may not be compatible with the new version due to significant changes in the UI elements, leading to failures during execution.

To address the test case failure:
1. Update test scripts: Modify the test scripts to accommodate the changes in the UI elements and application flow in the new version.

2. Identify alternative elements: Find alternative elements or methods to perform the saving actions in the new version and update the test scripts accordingly.

3. Review test case logic: Review the test case logic to ensure it aligns with the updated application flow and elements in the new version.

By addressing these potential reasons and making the necessary adjustments to the test scripts, the test case failure due to the missing save functionality elements in the new version can be resolved.

Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be inferred that the "Save" and "Save and Close" elements should be removed, which will affect the interaction with the "123" and "root1234" elements, so the possible cause you provided is incorrect.
At the same time, by analyzing the new version of HTML, it is found that there is no "Save" or "Save and Close" element in the new version, so the removal of these elements is the root cause of the failure of this test case, which also supports the analysis of the possible reasons for test failure.
In order to fix the test case, the related operations on the "123" and "root1234" elements need to be deleted.
The original test case is a test of the function of creating a new page, and in the new version of the HTML, it is impossible to find elements related to page creation, so there are no such elements as "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", and "Save" in the new version.
So in order to completely fix this test case, you need to delete all the test code related to the creation of the new page.
The original test case has a statement of sleep(1) in the comment, which is used to delay the test script for a period of 1 second. But in the new version of HTML, it can be seen that there is no way to find the "Logout" element, which means that the line of test code that contains the xpath expression "Logout" is also not useful, so you can also delete it, so there is no need to sleep.

The repaired test case is:

Based on the new version of the HTML you provided, it seems that the "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", "Save", and "Save and Close" elements have not been removed, but it is possible that they have been moved to another page. So this test case might fail due to the element's location not being found.
According to the error message, it can be inferred that the element with id "page_title" is not interactable. In the new version of the HTML, it is found that the test intent is to enter "123" in the input box, but the input box is disabled. So the root cause of the test failure is that the element with id "page_title" is disabled, leading to the subsequent test operation being unable to be performed.
In addition, the subsequent test case is trying to click on the "Save and Close" button, but the button does not exist in the new version of the HTML, so this test case is useless.

The repaired test case is:

Based on the understanding of the possible reasons for test failure, the "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", "Save", and "Save and Close" elements are all related to the saving function, so they are likely to cause test failures if they are removed. By checking the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the "Save Page", "Cancel", and "Save" elements are not found, but the "Save and Close" and "Save and Close" elements can be found, so the test case should only mention the two elements that are still there.
The "element not interactable" error message in the test failure indicates that the element is not interactable, and the new version of the HTML shows that the "Save and Close" element is a button element, which is interactable. So the root cause of the test failure was that the "Save Page" and "Save" elements were removed.
At the same time, according to the new version of the HTML, the ID of the element "Save and Close" is "save_and_close", which is consistent with the element reported in the error message.
So to fix the test case, you just need to delete the line of code that tests the "Save Page" and "Save" elements and not the one for "Save and Close".
The original test case tested a total of 4 elements related to saving functionality, and in the new version of the HTML there are only 2 elements related to saving functionality.

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 13:05:28,772:INFO:The testcase 4-4 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, we can find that the main issue is the removal of the "Save Page" feature in the new version. However, through a search in the new version of HTML, we can find that the "Save" and "Save and Close" elements still exist, so the test case may not have failed due to the removal of these elements.
In the error message, we see that the element that is not interactable has an id of "page_title", and from the new version of the HTML, we can find that the "Save" and "Save and Close" are located in the same form as the "page_title" element.
So, by analyzing the possible reasons for the test failure and the error message, it can be concluded that the test case failed because the "Save" and "Save and Close" elements were not found, and the "page_title" element was found but could not be interacted with, which is likely to be due to the presence of a blocking element above it.

The repaired test case is:

According to the possible causes of test failure you provided, it can be seen that "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", "Save" and "Save and Close" elements are not mentioned in the new version of the HTML you provided. Therefore, it is not necessary to try to find an alternative to these elements to fix the test case.
By analyzing the error message, "element not interactable" occurred in the operation of the "Page Title" and "Select Status" elements, which are likely to be the root cause of the test case failure.
Looking at the new HTML, I found that the IDs of the "Page Title" and "Select Status" elements have changed, and the "Select Status" element has also been changed to a read-only element. This change makes it impossible to interact with this element.
Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be concluded that the "Select Status" element was changed to read-only in the new version of the HTML. Therefore, it is impossible to set a value to this element in the test case.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="s2id_page_status"]/a').click()
...

In order to ensure that the repaired test case conforms to the potential format requirements for test input, the original test case was analyzed and it was found that a single click was made on the "Select Status" element, so in the repaired test case, the send_keys should be changed to click on the "Select Status" element.
2024-09-16 13:05:58,767:INFO:Cause of failure 5 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. In the old version, the "Save Page" button with the xpath "//*[@id="save-btn"]" is present, but it is not available in the new version.
2. The "Save and Close" button with the xpath "//*[@id="save-close-btn"]" from the old version is also not present in the new version.
3. The "Cancel" button with the xpath "//*[@id="cancel"]" is removed in the new version.
4. The "View" button with the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-composer_tab"]/div[1]/a" is no longer part of the new version.
5. The "Enable TINYMCE" button with the xpath "//*[@id="tinymce_switch"]" is not present in the new version.
6. The textarea for the Visual Page Composer with the xpath "//*[@id="page_content_ifr"]" is also removed in the new version.
7. The "Save" button with the xpath "//*[@id="save"]" from the old version is replaced by "Publish" with the xpath "//*[@id="cp_filter"]/div/div[1]/button[1]" in the new version.
8. The second "Save and Close" button with the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" is removed in the new version.

Based on the error message "selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable," the test case failure is likely due to the absence of the "Save Page" button in the new version. Since the "Save Page" button is usually a critical element for saving changes in a web application, its removal would prevent the test case from interacting with it and completing the save action, leading to the failure.

Additionally, the removal of other elements such as "Save and Close," "Cancel," "View," "Enable TINYMCE," and the Visual Page Composer textarea could also impact the functionality of the test case if it relied on interactions with these elements.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to interact with the new elements present in the new version of the web application. Specifically, the test case logic related to saving pages should be revised to accommodate the changes in button names and locations.

According to the new version of the HTML, we can see that the "Save and Close" and "Cancel" buttons mentioned in the possible causes of failure are not present in the new version of the HTML, while the "Save Page" button is still there. It can be inferred that the "Save Page" button mentioned in the possible cause of failure is probably the element with the xpath of "//*[@id="page_title-append-btn"]".
At the same time, the new version of the HTML does not contain the "View", "Enable TINYMCE", and "Visual Page Composer textarea" elements mentioned in the possible reasons for test failure.
The "Save" button mentioned in the possible reasons for test failure is still present in the new version of the HTML, and its xpath is "//*[@id="cp_filter"]/div/div[1]/button[1]".

By analyzing the possible reasons for test failure, it can be found that the new version of the HTML has the "Save" and "Save and Close" buttons.
The root cause of the test failure is that the "Save and Close" button with xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" has been removed, and not as stated in the possible reasons, the "Save" button.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to delete the line that contains the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" in the test case.
In addition, based on the analysis of the possible reasons for test failure, there are also elements that have been removed in the new version, such as the "Cancel" button, but in fact, there is still a "Cancel" button in the new version of the HTML.
At the same time, according to the new HTML, the xpath expression of the "Save and Close" button is "//*[@id="save-close-btn"]", not "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="page_title"]').send_keys("123")

driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="select2-results-3"]/li[2]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save-close-btn"]').click()
...

In the new version of the HTML, the xpath expressions of the "Save" and "Cancel" buttons are "//*[@id="page_cancel"]" and "//*[@id="page_cancel"]" respectively.
If you want to test whether these two buttons can be interacted with, you can add test steps to the test case accordingly.
2024-09-16 13:06:08,870:INFO:The testcase 5-3 is generated:
According to the analysis of possible test failures, the "Save Page", "Save and Close", "Cancel", "View", "Enable TINYMCE", and the textarea for the Visual Page Composer have been deleted, while the "Save" button has been replaced by "Publish". At the same time, the error message shows that the element with the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" is not interactable, so the "Save and Close" button is still present in the new version, but for some reason it cannot be interacted with.
In addition, the id of the new version of the element in the error message is "page_title" rather than "page_title", so the root cause of the test failure is that the "Save and Close" button cannot be interacted with.
The new version of the HTML does not contain any elements with the xpath in the test case, so the test case should not have any major element changes.

To fix the test case, you can simply delete the line of code in the test case that contains the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]".

It is recommended to modify the test case code to remove the relevant test code line.
At the same time, the "Cancel" button mentioned in the possible cause of test failure is not found in the new version of the HTML, and the xpath "//*[@id="cancel"]" described in the possible cause of test failure is not found in the test case.

According to the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be seen that there are many changes in the major elements, and among them, there is a very obvious "Save" button and "Save and Close" button that has been removed in the new version.
By understanding the new version of the HTML content, it can be found that there is a "Publish" button and a "Unpublish" button in the part that corresponds to the description of the test case in the analysis of the possible causes of test failure. Considering that the "Publish" button has a close meaning to the "Save" button in the analysis of the possible reasons for the test failure, and the xpath "//*[@id="save"]" also has a high similarity with the xpath "//*[@id="save-btn"]" in the error message, so the "Publish" button can be determined as a replacement for the "Save" button.
Therefore, the "Save and Close" button can be replaced with the "Unpublish" button, which can be deduced based on the information in the error message and the new version of HTML.
At the same time, the description of the possible test failure reasons also mentioned the removal of the "Cancel" button, but it was not found in the new version of the HTML, so the analysis is considered to be incorrect.
In addition, the "View" button, "Enable TINYMCE" button, and the Visual Page Composer textarea mentioned in the possible reasons for the test failure are not found in the new version of the HTML, and they are irrelevant in the context of the test case, so there is no need to consider.
Based on the understanding of the new version of the HTML and the error message, it is not hard to see that the possible reasons for the failure to mention the "Save and Close" and "Cancel" buttons are not actually relevant, and the "Save" button is the root cause of the failure.
So in order to fix the test case, you just need to replace the xpath "//*[@id="save_and_close"]" with "//*[@id="save-close-btn"]".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="save-close-btn"]').click()
