Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Search from keyword" and "Search" elements from the old version are missing in the new version. However, based on the error message provided, the first element removed ("Search from keyword") is not the root cause of the test case failure.

The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element using a CSS selector with the attribute "button[type="submit"]", but it is unable to find such an element in the new version of the application. This suggests that the "Enter" button has been changed in the new version, causing the test case to fail.

In the old version, the "Enter" button was located using the xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[1]/div/div/form/fieldset/button", whereas in the new version, the "Enter" button is located using the xpath "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input[3]". This change in the xpath of the "Enter" button is the root cause of the test case failure.

To address this issue, the test case needs to be updated with the new xpath for the "Enter" button in the new version of the application. Additionally, it is important to review all other test cases to ensure they are updated according to the changes in the application elements.

**Test Intent:**  
The test case `TestAddCourse.java` is intended to automate the process of adding a new course on a web application using Selenium WebDriver.  

1. **Setup:**  
   - The `@BeforeMethod` annotated method sets up the test environment by initializing the WebDriver, navigating to the base URL, and potentially interacting with a database (adding a category, deleting a course, and adding a user).

2. **Test Steps:**  
   - The `testAddCourse()` method performs the following actions:
     - Logs in with admin credentials.
     - Navigates to create a new course site.
     - Fills in course details such as title, official code, category, titular, and additional options.
     - Verifies the success message after creating the course.
     - Logs out as an admin.
     - Logs in as a regular user.
     - Enrolls in the newly created course.
     - Verifies enrollment success message.

3. **Validation:**  
   - The test validates that the course creation process is successful by checking the presence of a specific success message and that the user enrollment in the course is successful by verifying the enrollment success message.

4. **Cleanup:**  
   - The test case handles cleanup implicitly by quitting the WebDriver instance and re-initializing it for the subsequent steps, ensuring a clean state for the user login and enrollment verification.

5. **Expected Outcome:**  
   - The expected outcome of this test case is to verify that an admin can successfully create a new course and that a regular user can enroll in the newly created course without any errors.

6. **Note:**  
   - The elements listed in the currently tested page are not directly related to the test case but provide additional context about the page structure.

2024-10-26 21:47:34,311:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Based on the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions of the web application, the following changes are evident:

1. The "Manage my account" element from the old version is no longer present in the new version.
2. The "My messages" element has changed its position in the element list.
3. The xpath for the "Logout" element has changed in the new version.
4. The xpath for the "Continue" element has changed in the new version.

Given the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div"}

The error indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div", which is not found in the new version of the web application. This element seems to be related to the "Continue" element based on its position in the DOM structure. However, the xpath has changed in the new version, as mentioned earlier.

The most likely root cause of the test case failure is the change in the xpath for the "Continue" element. The test case is unable to locate this element in the new version using the provided xpath, leading to the NoSuchElementException.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the DOM structure or hierarchy affecting the xpath of elements.
- Changes in the element properties or attributes causing identification issues.
- Changes in the functionality or behavior of elements impacting test case execution.

To address this test case failure, you need to update the xpath of the "Continue" element in the test case to match the new version of the web application. Additionally, you may need to review and update other test cases affected by the changes in the web application elements to ensure their successful execution.

2024-10-26 21:49:43,582:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes that might have led to the test case failure:

1. "Manage my account" in the old version is no longer present in the new version.
2. The xpath for "My desktop," "My messages," "Platform administration," and "Manage my account" has changed in the new version.
3. The xpath for "Logout" has changed in the new version.
4. The xpath for "Continue" has changed in the new version.

Based on the error message provided, it states that there is no such element with the xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div" in the new version. This indicates that the xpath for the "Continue" button has changed from "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/p/a" in the old version to "//*[@id="claroBody"]/p/a" in the new version.

The root cause of the test case failure is likely the change in the xpath for the "Continue" button. The test case is failing to locate this element in the new version, leading to the NoSuchElementException error.

Other reasons for the test case failure could be:

1. Changes in the structure of the webpage impacting the xpath of elements.
2. Updates in the web application code affecting the identification of elements.
3. Changes in the CSS classes or attributes of elements causing them to be not found by the test script.

To address this issue, you need to update the xpath of the "Continue" button in your test script to match the new version. Additionally, review and update other xpaths that have changed in the new version to ensure the test cases can locate and interact with the elements correctly.

2024-10-26 21:50:21,544:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element "Manage my account" was present in the old version but is missing in the new version. The error message specifically mentions that it was unable to locate an element with xpath "//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div". This suggests that the test case was expecting the "Manage my account" element to be present and interactable on the page, but since it was removed in the new version, the test case failed to locate it and threw a NoSuchElement exception.

Root Cause:
The removal of the "Manage my account" element from the new version is the most likely root cause of the test case failure. The test case was designed to interact with this element, and its absence led to the failure.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in element locators: The xpath for some elements has changed between the old and new versions. For example, the xpath for "My desktop", "My messages", and "Platform administration" elements have been updated in the new version. If the test case is relying on these xpaths, it may fail due to the changes.
  
2. Missing element: The "Manage my account" element is missing in the new version, which could lead to test case failures if the test case interacts with this element.

3. Changes in element structure: The structure of the elements in the user banner and claro body seems to have been updated in the new version. For example, the "My User Account" element is a new addition in the new version. Any test cases relying on the previous structure may fail due to these changes.

In conclusion, the primary reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "Manage my account" element in the new version. Additionally, changes in element locators, missing elements, and changes in element structure could also contribute to test case failures when transitioning from the old version to the new version of the web application.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:

1. "My messages" element was moved from the second position in the old version to the third position in the new version.
2. "Platform administration" element was moved from the third position in the old version to the fourth position in the new version.
3. "Manage my account" element from the old version is missing in the new version.
4. "Logout" element was changed from xpath="//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a" to xpath="//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a".

The error message indicates that the test case failed to locate the element with xpath "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a" in the new version. This element corresponds to the "Logout" button in the old version, which has been modified in the new version.

Root cause of test case failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is the change in the xpath of the "Logout" button element from "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a" in the old version to "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/span/a" in the new version. This change in the xpath caused the test case to fail as it was unable to locate the element based on the old xpath.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Position changes: The movement of the "My messages" and "Platform administration" elements in the new version could also cause test case failures if the test script is dependent on the specific position of these elements.
2. Missing element: The absence of the "Manage my account" element in the new version could lead to test case failures if the test script interacts with this element.

Recommendation:
To address the test case failure, update the test script with the new xpaths for the elements that have changed in the new version. Additionally, review the test script logic to make it more robust and independent of the specific position of elements on the page to prevent future failures due to element reordering.

2024-10-26 21:56:05,111:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
From the provided information, the major elements of the old and new versions have changed significantly. The main changes are as follows:

1. "Manage my account" element is removed in the new version.
2. The xpath for the "Logout" element is changed in the new version.
3. The xpath for the "My desktop," "My messages," "Platform administration," and "Logout" elements have been restructured in the new version.

Considering the error message:
```
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a"}
```

The error message indicates that the test case failed to locate the element corresponding to "//*[@id="userBannerRight"]/ul/li[3]/span/a" in the new version. This element is the "Manage my account" element from the old version, which has been removed in the new version. Therefore, the first element removed is indeed the root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the structure of the elements (e.g., xpath) in the new version.
- Elements being renamed or reorganized in the new version.
- Incorrect xpath provided in the test case due to changes in the application.

To address the test case failure, you need to update the test case to reflect the changes in the new version. Specifically, you should remove any references to the removed element ("Manage my account") and update the xpaths for the elements that have been restructured or renamed in the new version.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. "Search from keyword" element was present in the old version but not in the new version.
2. "Search" element had a different xpath in the new version compared to the old version.
3. Two new elements related to the course "CS212 - Computer Science" were added in the new version.
4. "Search from keyword :" element was added in the new version with a different xpath.
5. "Search" element had a different xpath in the new version compared to the old version.

Based on the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"}", the root cause of the test case failure is most likely the absence of the element with the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]" in the new version. This xpath was not present in either the old or new version's major elements, indicating a possible discrepancy in the test case itself.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the element identifiers: The xpath of the "Search" element was different in the new version, which might have caused the test case to fail if the test script was referencing the old xpath.
2. Addition of new elements: The addition of new elements related to the course "CS212 - Computer Science" could have impacted the test flow or interactions with existing elements.
3. Removal of existing elements: The absence of the "Search from keyword" element in the new version could have affected the test case if it was a critical step in the test flow.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in element identifiers and test flow in the new version of the web application. Additionally, the missing element "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]" should be reviewed to ensure its relevance to the test case scenario.

Root cause of test case failure:
The error message indicates that the test case failed because it was unable to locate the element with the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]" in the new version. This xpath was not present in the major elements listed for the old or new versions. However, the first element removed from the old version was "Search from keyword," and it was replaced with "Search from keyword :" in the new version. This change in the xpath may have caused the failure as the test case might be looking for the old xpath and not finding it.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in element locators: The xpaths for the elements "Search from keyword" and "Search" were updated in the new version. If the test case is hardcoded to use the old xpaths, it will fail to locate the elements in the new version.
2. Element structure changes: The structure of the elements might have changed in the new version, causing the test case to fail if it is dependent on a specific structure or hierarchy.
3. Missing element: The error message indicates that the element "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]" could not be located. If this element is crucial for the test case and was removed or changed in the new version, it would lead to a failure.

To address the test case failure, update the test case to use the correct xpaths for the elements in the new version and ensure that any dependencies on specific element structures or missing elements are addressed.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:
1. In the old version, there was a "Search from keyword" element with the xpath `//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]`, which is not present in the new version.
2. In the new version, there are two "CS212 - Computer Science" elements with xpaths `//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]` and `//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]`.
3. In the new version, there is a "Search from keyword :" element with the xpath `//*[@id="keyword"]`.
4. In the new version, the "Search" element has a different xpath `//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]` compared to the old version.

The error message `org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]}"` indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element using xpath `//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]`, but this element is not found in the new version of the web application.

Based on the comparison of major elements and the error message, the most likely root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the "Search from keyword" element from the new version. This change led to the test case not being able to find the expected element with the xpath `//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]`, resulting in a `NoSuchElementException`.

Other reasons for the test case failure could be:
1. Changes in the structure of the page leading to different xpaths for elements like "CS212 - Computer Science" and "Search".
2. Changes in the functionality of the search feature, causing the test case to interact with elements differently.
3. Errors in the test case script or test data that are not handling the changes in the new version correctly.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application. This includes updating the xpaths of elements that have changed and modifying the test steps to accommodate any new elements or functionality.

Based on the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"}

The error message indicates that the test is trying to locate an element with the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", which is not found in either the old or new versions' major elements. This element seems to be missing from both versions' major elements, which suggests that it might have been present in the test case but was not included in the provided major elements list.

Root Cause and Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Missing Element: The error message points to an element that is not included in the provided major elements for both versions. This missing element is likely the root cause of the test case failure.
2. Changes in Element Locators: The new version introduces new elements and potentially modifies the structure of existing elements, leading to changes in element locators. Test cases relying on outdated locators will fail due to these changes.
3. Structural Changes: The addition of new elements and changes in the structure of the page can impact the functionality of the test case, leading to failures.

To address the test case failure, the missing element "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]" needs to be identified and included in the major elements list for the new version. Additionally, the test case may require updates to accommodate changes in element locators and structural modifications introduced in the new version of the web application.

2024-10-26 22:14:32,642:INFO:Cause of failure 5 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the key change that likely caused the test case failure is the removal of the element related to searching by keyword:

Old version:
1. "Search from keyword" xpath="//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]"

New version:
3. "Search from keyword :" xpath="//*[@id="keyword"]"

The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", which does not exist in either the old or new versions' major elements.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. **Root Cause:** The main element related to searching by keyword was removed in the new version, causing the test case to fail when attempting to search for "Computer Science" using an xpath that no longer exists in the updated version.

2. **Other Reasons:**
   - The xpath for the "Search" button has changed in the new version, which could also contribute to the test case failure.
   - The structure of the elements within the page seems to have changed significantly between the old and new versions, which might have affected the xpath locators used in the test case.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpath for the search functionality and any other affected elements. Additionally, it may be necessary to adjust the test logic to accommodate the changes in the page structure between the old and new versions of the web application.

The broken statement in the test case that needs to be fixed is:
```java
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]")).click();
```

To fix the broken statement, we need to update it with a new xpath that corresponds to the element in the new version of the web application. Based on the provided HTML of the new version, the correct xpath to click on the "Computer Science" link is:
```java
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//td[contains(text(),'CS212 - Computer Science')]/following-sibling::td/a/img")).click();
```

This updated xpath locates the "Computer Science" link based on the preceding text "CS212 - Computer Science" within a table cell and then navigates to the following sibling cell to find the link element to click on.

This fix addresses the issue by updating the xpath to locate the correct element in the new version of the web application.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following changes have occurred:

1. In the old version, the search box element was identified by xpath "//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]". In the new version, this element was replaced with a new search box identified by xpath "//*[@id="keyword"]". This change indicates that the search box element was updated and the old xpath is no longer valid.

2. In the old version, the search button element was identified by xpath "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button". In the new version, this element was replaced with a new search button identified by xpath "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]". This change indicates that the search button element was updated and the old xpath is no longer valid.

Based on the error message provided: "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"}", it seems like the test case is trying to locate an element containing the text 'Computer Science' using the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", but this element is not present in either the old or new version major elements.

The root cause of the test case failure is likely the removal of the element with text 'Computer Science' from the page, as indicated by the error message. Additionally, changes in the xpaths for the search box and search button elements in the new version also contribute to the failure as the test script is unable to locate these elements using the old xpaths.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the correct xpaths for the search box and search button elements in the new version. Additionally, the test case logic that interacts with the element containing 'Computer Science' text needs to be reviewed and updated based on the changes in the application interface.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. **"Search from keyword" element**:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="keyword"]"

2. **"Search" button element**:
   - Old version: xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button"
   - New version: xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]"

3. **Additional elements in the new version**:
   - Two new elements related to "CS212 - Computer Science" with xpaths ending in "/tr[1]/td[1]" and "/tr[2]/td[1]"

Based on the error message provided:
- The root cause of the test case failure is related to the missing element that the test is trying to locate: xpath="//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"
- This xpath seems to be referring to a link containing the text "Computer Science" which is not present in either the old or new version's major elements.

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could be:
- The test script was not updated to reflect the changes in the new version's elements.
- The test script is referring to a new element that was introduced in the new version but is not handled correctly.
- There might be timing issues or dynamic loading of elements impacting the test execution.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to interact with the correct elements based on the new version's structure. Additionally, considering dynamic loading or timing issues while locating elements might also help in making the test case more robust.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following changes have occurred:

1. "Search from keyword" element is removed in the new version.
2. "Search" element has been repositioned and its xpath has changed in the new version.
3. Two new elements "CS212 - Computer Science" have been added in the new version with different xpaths.
4. "Search from keyword" element has been replaced with a new element "Search" with a different xpath in the new version.

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. Root Cause: The primary reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "Search from keyword" element in the new version. This element is no longer present in the updated version, leading to the NoSuchElementException when the test case tries to locate it.

2. Repositioning of the "Search" element: The repositioning of the "Search" element in the new version with a different xpath can also contribute to the test case failure. If the test case is dependent on the specific xpath of the element, it will fail when the xpath changes.

3. Addition of new elements: The addition of two new elements "CS212 - Computer Science" in the new version may also impact the test case. If the test case is not updated to account for these new elements, it may fail to interact with them correctly.

4. Replacement of elements: The replacement of the "Search from keyword" element with a new element "Search" with a different xpath can cause test case failure if the test case is not updated to reflect this change.

In conclusion, the primary reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "Search from keyword" element. The repositioning, addition, and replacement of other elements in the new version can also contribute to the failure. To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated to accommodate these changes in the new version of the web application.

Comparison of major elements between old and new versions:
1. Removed element from the old version: "Search from keyword" xpath="//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]"
2. Added elements in the new version:
   - "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]"
   - "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]"
   - "Search from keyword:" xpath="//*[@id="keyword"]"
   - "Search" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]"

Root cause of test case failure:
The error message indicates that the test is trying to locate an element using the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", which is not present in either the old or new version's major elements. This suggests that the test script is referencing a new element that was not part of the elements in the old version or added as part of the new version. Since the element "Search from keyword" was removed from the old version and not present in the new version, the test script might be trying to interact with this element, causing the NoSuchElementException.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Changes in element locators: The xpath for the "Search" button has changed between the old and new versions. If the test script is using the old xpath to locate the "Search" button, it will fail to find the element in the new version.
2. Changes in page structure: The introduction of new elements like "CS212 - Computer Science" and "Search from keyword:" in the new version may have caused a shift in the page structure, leading to the failure of test cases relying on the old elements.
3. Incorrect element identification: If the test script is looking for elements based on text content ("Computer Science") rather than unique identifiers, it can lead to test failures when the text content changes or is not present in the elements.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to use the correct element locators from the new version and avoid referencing elements that have been removed. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the test scripts are robust and not solely dependent on text content for element identification.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the main changes are as follows:

Old Version:
1. "Search from keyword" xpath="//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]"
2. "Search" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button"

New Version:
1. "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]"
2. "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]"
3. "Search from keyword:" xpath="//*[@id="keyword"]"
4. "Search" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]"

Based on the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", it seems like the test case is trying to locate an element with the text "Computer Science" using the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", but this element is not present in either the old or new version major elements list.

The key change in the new version is the addition of elements related to "CS212 - Computer Science" and the change in the search elements. The first element removed in the new version is "Search from keyword" xpath="//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]", which is most likely the root cause of the test case failure as it indicates a change in the search functionality implementation.

Possible reasons for the test case failure:
1. Element locators have changed: The xpath for search elements and course elements have been updated in the new version, causing the test case to fail when trying to interact with these elements.
2. Missing element: The test case is looking for an element with the text "Computer Science" using an xpath that does not match any elements in the new version, leading to a NoSuchElementException.
3. Search functionality changes: The removal of the "Search from keyword" element suggests a change in the search functionality, which could impact how search queries are performed and results displayed.

To address the test case failure, you may need to update the test case to use the new element locators and adjust the search functionality interactions based on the changes in the new version.

Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. The "Search from keyword" element with xpath "//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]" from the old version is replaced with "Search from keyword :" element with xpath "//*[@id="keyword"]" in the new version.
2. The "Search" button element with xpath "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button" from the old version is replaced with a different "Search" button element with xpath "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]" in the new version.
3. Two new elements related to "CS212 - Computer Science" are added in the new version with xpaths "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]" and "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]".

Based on the error message provided, which states "no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", it seems that the test case is trying to locate an element containing the text 'Computer Science' using the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", but this element does not exist in either the old or new versions' major elements.

The root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the removal of the element related to 'Computer Science' which was present in the old version but is not present in the new version. This suggests that the test case was not updated to reflect the changes in the application interface, leading to a mismatch in the expected elements.

In addition to the root cause, other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in element identifiers (xpath) leading to incorrect element selection.
2. Addition of new elements not accounted for in the test case.
3. Changes in the layout or structure of the webpage affecting element visibility and accessibility.

To resolve the test case failure, the test case needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the application, ensuring that the correct elements are targeted for interaction. Additionally, verifying and updating element locators in the test case based on the new version's elements will help in successful test execution.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:

1. In the old version, there was a "Search from keyword" element with xpath "//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]", which is missing in the new version.
2. In the new version, there are two elements related to "CS212 - Computer Science" with xpaths "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]" and "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]". These were not present in the old version.
3. In the new version, there is a new element "Search from keyword :" with xpath "//*[@id="keyword"]", which was not present in the old version.
4. In the new version, the "Search" button's xpath has changed to "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]".

Based on the error message provided, "no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"}", it seems like the test case is trying to locate an anchor element with text "Computer Science" which does not exist in either the old or new version's major elements list.

The most likely root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the "Search from keyword" element from the new version. This removal may have impacted the flow of the test case, leading to subsequent elements not being located as expected. Additionally, the change in the xpath for the "Search" button could also contribute to the failure of the test case.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the elements' xpaths and the addition/removal of elements in the new version. Specifically, the test case should be modified to interact with the new elements introduced in the new version and adjust the xpath selectors accordingly.

2024-10-26 22:17:27,065:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:
1. In the old version, there were elements related to searching by keyword and a search button.
2. In the new version, the search functionality seems to have been redesigned. The old search box and search button have been replaced with new elements such as specific course listings (CS212 - Computer Science) and a new search input field and button.

Analyzing the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"}", it indicates that the test is trying to locate an element that contains the text 'Computer Science' using the xpath selector "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", but it is unable to find it.

Based on the error message and the comparison of elements, the root cause of the test case failure is that the element with the text 'Computer Science' cannot be located in the new version because it seems to have been removed or changed significantly. 

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could be:
1. Changes in the structure of the web page: The new version may have a different structure or layout which is causing the xpath selectors to fail in locating the elements.
2. Changes in the functionality: The search functionality has been redesigned in the new version, which might have affected how elements are located and interacted with.
3. Incorrect xpath selectors: The xpath selectors used in the test case may not be updated to match the new elements in the new version, leading to element not found errors.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the correct xpath selectors for the new elements in the new version. Additionally, it is important to review and update the test scripts whenever there are changes in the application to ensure they are aligned with the latest version.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:

1. "Search from keyword" xpath="//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]" (Old version)
   - Removed in the new version.
   
2. "Search" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button" (Old version)
   - Changed to "Search" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]" in the new version.
   
3. "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[1]" (New version)
4. "CS212 - Computer Science" xpath="//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[1]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]" (New version)
   - Added in the new version.
   
5. "Search from keyword :" xpath="//*[@id="keyword"]" (New version)
   - Added in the new version.

Based on the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"}

The test case failed due to the inability to locate the element with the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')". This xpath is not present in either the old or new versions' major elements, which indicates that this element might have been added in the test case but not correctly handled in the new version.

The root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the "Search from keyword" element in the new version, as indicated by the note provided. This removal might have caused the subsequent search functionality to fail, leading to the test case not being able to locate the "CS212 - Computer Science" element.

In addition to the root cause, other reasons for the test case failure could include:
- Changes in the structure of the elements affecting the xpath locators.
- Introduction of new elements impacting the flow of the test case.
- Changes in the naming conventions or attributes of elements causing identification issues.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version's elements and adjust the xpath locators accordingly. Additionally, any new elements introduced should be incorporated into the test case flow to ensure proper execution.

2024-10-26 22:20:58,253:INFO:Cause of failure 5 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:
1. In the old version, there was an element for searching by keyword with the xpath "//*[@id="coursesearchbox_keyword"]". This element is missing in the new version.
2. In the old version, the search button had the xpath "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button". In the new version, the search button has a different xpath "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[2]/blockquote[2]/form/input[2]".

Given the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]"", we can deduce the following reasons for the test case failure:
1. The test case is trying to locate an element with the xpath "//a[contains(text(),'Computer Science')]", which does not exist in either the old or new version's major elements. This indicates a discrepancy between the test case expectation and the actual elements present in the application.
2. The removal of the element for searching by keyword in the new version could also impact the test case, especially if the test case relies on searching functionality.

Therefore, the root cause of the test case failure is likely the missing element for searching by keyword in the new version. Additionally, the change in the xpath for the search button could also contribute to the failure. To address this issue, the test case needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the application's major elements, such as updating the xpath for the search button and adapting the test case to accommodate the absence of the search by keyword element.
