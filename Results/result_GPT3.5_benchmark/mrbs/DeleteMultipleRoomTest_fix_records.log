2024-10-31 22:33:04,862:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Name" element in the old version has been removed in the new version. This removal is the root cause of the test case failure, as indicated by the error message stating that the element "/html/body/form/input[3]" could not be located.

Root Cause:
1. Removal of "Name" element: In the old version, the "Name" field was located using the xpath "/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input". However, in the new version, this element has been removed, leading to the test case failure as the test script is unable to locate this element.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in element identifiers: The new version uses different identifiers (xpath values) for the "Name", "Password", and "Log in" elements compared to the old version. This change in element identifiers can also contribute to test case failure if the test script is not updated accordingly.
2. Change in element hierarchy: The structure of the form elements in the new version may have changed compared to the old version, leading to xpath values that no longer match the elements in the updated web application.

Recommendation:
To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application. Specifically, the script needs to be modified to interact with the new "Name" element using the xpath "//*[@id="NewUserName"]" instead of the old xpath value. Additionally, any other changes in element identifiers or hierarchy should be accounted for in the test script to ensure its compatibility with the updated web application.

2024-10-31 22:33:50,359:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Log in" button's xpath has changed from "/html/body/form/input[5]" in the old version to "//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input" in the new version. 

The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate the element using the old xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]", which no longer exists in the new version. This change in the xpath of the "Log in" button is most likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the HTML document: If the structure of the HTML document has been significantly altered in the new version, it could result in elements being located in different positions or having different identifiers, causing the test case to fail.
  
2. Changes in element identifiers: If the identifiers of other elements have also been modified in the new version, it could lead to the test case not being able to locate and interact with those elements as expected.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to use the new xpath for the "Log in" button ("/html/body/form/input[5]" to "//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input") in the new version. Additionally, any other changes in the HTML structure or element identifiers should be identified and reflected in the test script to ensure its compatibility with the updated version of the web application.

   - Delete one room by clicking on the delete button and confirming the deletion.
   - Delete another room in a similar manner.
   - Attempt to delete a third room and then verify that the message "No rooms." is displayed on the page indicating that all rooms have been deleted successfully.

2024-10-31 22:46:24,873:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the first element "07:00" with xpath "//*[@id="test_table"]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/a" from the old version is not present in the new version. This missing element is likely the root cause of the test case failure. 

The changes in the structure and xpath of the elements from the old version to the new version caused the test case to fail due to the inability to locate the expected element in the updated web application. 

Additionally, the error message "org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//a[text()='Admin']"}" indicates that the test is trying to locate an element with the text 'Admin', which is not found in the current page. This error message is related to a different element not related to the elements being compared, but it signifies another reason for the test case failure due to missing or changed elements in the new version of the web application.

In summary, the main reason for the test case failure is the missing element "07:00" in the new version, which led to the failure to locate the expected element during the test execution. Additionally, the error message related to another element not found in the page indicates further issues with element identification or presence in the updated version of the web application.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the following changes can be observed:

Old Version:
1. "Name:" (Add Area input box)
2. "Add Area"
3. "Name:" (Add Room input box for name)
4. "Description:" (Add Room input box for description)
5. "Capacity:" (Add Room input box for capacity)

2. "Change"
3. "edit"
4. "delete"
5. "Name:"
6. "Description:"
7. "Capacity:"
8. "Add Room"

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The error message indicates that the test case failed due to the inability to locate the element with the xpath "/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/ul/li[1]/a[1]". This xpath does not match any of the major elements provided for both the old and new versions.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. The major elements for adding an area and room have completely changed in the new version. The elements related to adding an area and room in the old version have been replaced with different elements in the new version. This change in element structure can lead to test case failures as the automation scripts may still be referring to the old elements.
   
2. The xpath structure in the error message "/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/ul/li[1]/a[1]" seems to be different from the xpaths provided for both old and new versions. This discrepancy in the xpath structure could also be a reason for the test case failure.

3. It's possible that the test case is trying to interact with a navigation element or link that has been removed or relocated in the new version, causing the "NoSuchElementException" error.

In conclusion, the test case failed due to changes in the major elements and xpath structure between the old and new versions of the web application. Updating the automation scripts to reflect the new element structure and correcting the xpath for the target element should resolve the test case failure.

Based on the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions, the main changes are as follows:

1. The element related to "Name:" (Add Area input box) in the old version has been removed in the new version.
   Old version xpath: "//*[@id="content"]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/form/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/input"
   New version xpath: "//*[@id="room_name"]"

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The error message indicates that the element "/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/ul/li[1]/a[1]" could not be located, which is related to the "Name:" input box for adding an area in the old version. Since this element was removed in the new version and replaced with a different element for room name ("//*[@id="room_name"]"), the test case is failing because the automation script is still trying to locate the old element which no longer exists.

Other Possible Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in XPath: The XPath expressions used to locate elements have changed between the old and new versions. If the automation script is not updated with the new XPaths, it will fail to locate the elements correctly.
2. Structural Changes: The structure of the web page may have been redesigned in the new version, leading to changes in the placement of elements. If the automation script is dependent on specific locations of elements, it may fail due to structural changes.
3. Element IDs: If the IDs of elements have changed between versions, the automation script needs to be updated with the new IDs to locate the elements accurately.
4. Functional Changes: If the functionality of the web application has been altered in the new version, the test cases may need to be revised to accommodate these changes.

In summary, the test case failed primarily because the element related to "Name:" for adding an area was removed in the new version, leading to a NoSuchElementException. Updating the automation script with the new element locators and accommodating any other changes in the web application will be essential to address the test case failures.

Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes:

1. In the old version, there was an element related to adding an area using xpath="//*[@id="content"]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/form/input". This element is missing in the new version.

Based on the error message provided:
- The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with xpath="/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/ul/li[1]/a[1]", which is not present in either the old or new versions of the major elements.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is the missing element related to adding an area in the new version. This missing element is likely the first element removed during the update, which aligns with the note provided.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in Element Structure: The structure of the elements has been reorganized in the new version, which may have caused the test case to fail in locating the elements based on the provided xpaths.
2. Change in Naming Convention: The names of the elements have been updated in the new version, which may have caused the test case to fail if the test script references the old element names.
3. Change in Element Placement: The placement of elements within the HTML structure may have changed, leading to the test case failing to locate the elements using the provided xpaths.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpaths and element names corresponding to the elements in the new version. Additionally, the test script may need to be adjusted to accommodate changes in the element structure and placement.

2024-10-31 23:03:19,735:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the main difference is the change in the XPath locators for the "YES!" and "NO!" elements. In the old version, the XPath locators were more specific and directly pointed to the elements using their positions in the DOM structure, while in the new version, the XPath locators are more generic and use the id attribute to locate the elements.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the removal of the first element in the old version, which is the "YES!" element located at xpath="/html/body/center/h1[2]/a[1]". In the new version, the corresponding "YES!" element is now located at xpath="//*[@id="del_yes"]". The test case is failing because the test script is still trying to locate the "YES!" element using the old XPath locator, which no longer exists in the new version.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Inadequate XPath locators: The new version uses more generic XPath locators based on the id attribute, which can be prone to changes if the ids are modified or removed. This can lead to test case failures if the element locators are not robust enough to handle such changes.
   
2. Lack of element identification strategy: Relying solely on XPath locators for element identification can make the test scripts fragile. It is recommended to use more reliable methods like CSS selectors or unique attributes in combination with XPath to locate elements.

3. DOM structure changes: If there were significant changes in the DOM structure between the old and new versions, the XPath locators based on the previous structure may no longer be valid in the updated version, causing test case failures.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to use the new XPath locators for the "YES!" and "NO!" elements in the new version. Additionally, it is advisable to enhance the element identification strategy to make the test scripts more robust and resistant to future changes.

2024-10-31 23:06:36,000:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, it is evident that the first element "Name:" (Add Area text box) from the old version is missing in the new version. This missing element is likely the root cause of the test case failure as indicated by the error message "NoSuchElementException" for the xpath corresponding to the missing element in the new version.

Root cause for the test case failure:
1. "Name:" (Add Area text box) element is no longer present in the new version.
2. The xpath in the error message ("/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]") corresponds to an element that could be related to the missing element in the new version.
3. The test case is looking for an element that is not available in the updated version, leading to the "NoSuchElementException" error.

Other reasons for test case failure:
1. Change in the structure of the web page: The layout and structure of the page seem to have been updated in the new version, leading to changes in the xpath of elements.
2. Different naming conventions: The naming conventions for elements have changed in the new version ("Area:" instead of "Name:" for Add Area).
3. Different form structure: The form structure for adding a room may have been modified, causing the xpath for elements related to adding a room to change.

Recommendation:
1. Update the test case to reflect the changes in the new version by modifying the xpaths and element locators to match the updated structure.
2. Verify and update any other test cases that may be impacted by the changes in the new version to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
3. Communicate with the development team to understand the changes made in the new version and ensure test cases are updated accordingly.
