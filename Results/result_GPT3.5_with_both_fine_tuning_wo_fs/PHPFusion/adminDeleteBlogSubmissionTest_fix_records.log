2024-04-22 11:10:51,459:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:

1. In the old version, the element "Review Blog Submission" was located using the xpath "/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/section[2]/div/div/div[2]/div/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".
2. In the new version, the element "Review Blog Submission" was changed to the xpath "//*[@id="blog"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".

Given the error message indicating that the element with xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" could not be located, we can infer the following:

1. The first element removed is the likely root cause of the test case failure. In this case, the element "Review Blog Submission" in the old version was located at a different xpath ("/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/section[2]/div/div/div[2]/div/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a") compared to the new version ("//*[@id="blog"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a").
   
2. The error message is indicating that the test case is looking for the element in a different location than where it is present in the new version of the application. This mismatch in the element's xpath is causing the test case to fail as it is unable to locate the expected element.

To address this issue and fix the test case failure, you should update the test case to use the correct xpath for locating the "Review Blog Submission" element in the new version of the application. Update the xpath in the test case to match the new location of the element, which is "//*[@id="blog"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a". By making this adjustment, the test case should be able to locate the element successfully in the new version of the application.

2024-04-22 11:11:03,887:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
According to the new version of the HTML, the xpath of the "Review Blog Submission" element is "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".
There is no element in the new version of the HTML with an id of "admin_password".
However, by analyzing the intent of the test and the error message, it can be inferred that the root cause of the test failure is that the "Review Blog Submission" element could not be found. And the xpath of the "Review Blog Submission" element was changed.
So there is a contradiction in the information you provide. The xpath "//*[@id="admin_password"]" is indeed in the original test case, but from the new version of the HTML, there is no such element.
It can be inferred that the "admin_password" element was removed in the new version of the update.
Therefore, to fix the test case, you need to delete the line of code in the test case that locates the "admin_password" element.
In order to avoid the situation where the xpath is inconsistent with the one in the error message, and the root cause of the test failure cannot be found, you need to change the xpath to "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" in the error message to "//*[@id="blog"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".

Based on the new version of the HTML, we can see that there is no such id "admin_password" or "admin-login-form" element.
At the same time, you can find the "Review Blog Submission" element using the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".
So the xpath in the test case is consistent with the error message.
So there is a bug in the error message.
According to the possible reasons you mentioned, the "Review Blog Submission" element has indeed been changed. It is now a child element of a <tr> tag, and the parent element has an id of "tab-content-blog", which is not a <div> tag.
So to fix the test case, you need to change "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" to "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".

In the possible causes of test failure that you analyzed, you said that the "Review Blog Submission" element was the first removed major element in the new version, but I think it's wrong. Because the new version of the HTML you provided includes the "Review Blog Submission" element and it is still in the table, so the root cause of the test failure is not that the element was removed.
By examining the new version of the HTML, we can see that the "Review Blog Submission" element is in the last column of the table, but the xpath in the error message is trying to locate the fifth column, which is incorrect.
So to fix the test case, you need to change '//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a' to '//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a'.
In addition, based on the test error message, the xpath in the test case that might also appear in the error message is '//*[@id="delete-btn"]', but this element can be located in the new version of the HTML, so it does not need to be deleted or modified.
And according to the new version of the HTML you provided, there are no elements with ids "admin_password" and "admin-login-form", which appear in the test case, which means that those two elements have been removed in the new version. Since they are not part of the test intent, they do not need to be tested, so they do not need to be deleted from the test case.

According to the possible reasons you provided for the failure, it is not accurate that "Review Blog Submission" is the root cause of the failure.
By examining the new version of the HTML, I found that "Review Blog Submission" is a hyperlink element inside a table cell element, and the reported xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" seems to be trying to locate the "Review Blog Submission" element in the only row of the table, so it must be in the <tbody> element.
So I looked for the "Review Blog Submission" element in the new HTML, and I found it at the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".

Based on the error message and the possible reasons for failure you provided, the root cause of the failure is that the xpath in the test case is inconsistent with the new version of the HTML, and this inconsistency is caused by a change in the element, not by a change in the root element of the xpath.

2024-04-22 11:12:23,941:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Based on the comparison of the major elements of the old and new versions, the following changes can be observed:

1. In the old version, the element "Review Blog Submission" was located using the xpath "/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/section[2]/div/div/div[2]/div/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".
2. In the new version, the element "Review Blog Submission" is located using the xpath "//*[@id="blog"]/div/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a".

The error message indicates that the test case failed due to a NoSuchElementException, specifically mentioning that the element with xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" could not be located.

Based on the error message and the comparison of elements, it can be inferred that the root cause of the test case failure is the change in the xpath of the "Review Blog Submission" element. The new xpath in the new version differs from the old xpath, leading to the test case not being able to locate the element as expected.

Other possible reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the webpage: If the structure of the webpage was altered significantly between the old and new versions, it could impact the location of elements and cause test case failures.
2. Changes in element attributes: If the attributes of the elements were modified in the new version, such as ids, classes, or other properties, it could affect the way elements are located by the test script.
3. Timing issues: If there were delays in loading the webpage or elements in the new version, it could result in the test case attempting to locate elements before they are available, leading to failures.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new xpath for the "Review Blog Submission" element in the new version to ensure that it can be located correctly. Additionally, any other changes in the webpage structure or element attributes should be taken into account while updating the test script.

Based on the new version of the HTML, the root cause of the test case failure is that the "Review Blog Submission" element was not found, and not just the xpath change.
At the same time, according to the possible reasons for the test failure you mentioned, it can be inferred that the changes in the structure of the webpage and the changes in the element attributes were the main reasons for the failure of the test case, because the new version of the HTML shows that the layout of the webpage has changed significantly.

However, I found a similar element with the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" in the new HTML source code.

By comparing the possible reasons for test failure with the error message and the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the xpath "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" in the test case is very similar to the error message xpath, and in the new version of the HTML it is also found that there is indeed a "Review Blog Submission" element with a similar xpath.
So it can be inferred that the xpath in the error message in the test case is likely to be a wrong expression of the original xpath, and the xpath in the test case should be "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a" as stated in the error message.
Based on the new version of the HTML, it is found that the xpath of the "Review Blog Submission" element is "//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a", which is consistent with the new version of the test case, but not the root cause of the error.
By understanding the intent of the test case, it can be concluded that the root cause of the test failure is that the element to be clicked is the "Review Blog Submission" element, not the "Delete" button, as the reported error message mentions.

Based on the possible reasons for the test failure, it is found that the xpath of the root cause element has not changed, and it is exactly the same in both versions of the new and old HTML.
At the same time, in the understanding of the test intent, I found that the "Review Blog Submission" element is not the same as the root cause element in the error message.
By understanding the test intent and finding out the specific error message, it can be concluded that the intent of this test case is to first locate the "Review Blog Submission" element and then click on it. The real intent is to check if the admin user can delete a blog.
According to the new version of the HTML, the element with id "Review Blog Submission" is a hyperlink inside a table, and the element is located in the third column of the table.
So to fix the test case, you just need to change the xpath to locate the element to '//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]/a' to '//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]'.
This change will make the test case run to completion in the new version of the web application.

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_name"])[2]').send_keys("admin")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_pass"])[2]').send_keys("admin123")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="login"]').click()
# sleep(1)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="navigation-user"]/ul/li[5]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin_password"]').send_keys("root1234")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="admin-login-form"]/div/div/button').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/a').click()
sleep(1)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="adl"]/li[2]/ul/li[6]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="blog"]/li[4]/a').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="tab-content-blog"]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[5]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="delete-btn"]').click()
# sleep(1)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="dduser"]').click()
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//a[contains(text(),"Logout")])[2]').click()
driver.close()
