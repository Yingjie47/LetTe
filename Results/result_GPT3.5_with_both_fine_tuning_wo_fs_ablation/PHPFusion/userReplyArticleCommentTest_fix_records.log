2024-09-16 16:30:17,692:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify several changes that could have led to the test case failure:

1. The "shout_message-field" element with various sub-elements like smiley button, bold button, underline button, insert link button, insert email button, insert image button in the old version has been replaced by a "Leave a Comment textarea" in the new version. This significant change in the structure of the elements is likely the root cause of the test case failure as the test case is unable to locate the expected element.

2. The "Post Comment" button associated with the "shout_message-field" in the old version has been retained in both versions, but its xpath has been updated. This change in xpath could also contribute to the test case failure if the test script is referencing the old xpath.

3. The "Manage Comments" element in the old version has been replaced by a similar element with a different xpath in the new version. If the test case interacts with this element, the change in xpath could cause failure.

4. The "Edit" and "Delete" elements in the old version have been removed in the new version. If the test case includes actions related to these elements, their absence could lead to failures.

Based on the error message provided, the test case failed due to being unable to locate an element with a specific xpath. This xpath does not match any of the major elements listed in either the old or new versions, indicating a potential issue with the test script or a new element introduced that is not accounted for in the test case.

In conclusion, the primary reason for the test case failure is the significant structural changes in the main elements between the old and new versions, particularly the removal of the "shout_message-field" element and its associated sub-elements. Additionally, changes in xpaths and the removal of certain elements could also contribute to the failure. The error message suggests a mismatch between the expected xpath and the actual element in the new version, highlighting a potential gap in the test script's element identification logic.

2024-09-16 16:30:30,568:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
According to the possible reasons for the test failure, in the new version of the HTML, the "shout_message-field" element was found, which has many sub-elements such as smiley button, bold button, underline button, insert link button, insert email button, insert image button. The "Post Comment" button element is also found to have a similar xpath in the new version of the HTML.
At the same time, the "Manage Comments" element and its "Edit" and "Delete" sub-elements were found in the new version of the HTML, and there are no such elements in the new version of the HTML.
By comparing the new test case with the error message, it can be found that the xpath of the error reporting is "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/input", which is quite similar to the xpath of the "Post Comment" button in the new version of the HTML.
So, by looking at the possible reasons for the test failure and the error message, it can be inferred that there was probably a change in the new version of the HTML that moved the "Post Comment" button up one level, which caused the test case to fail to locate the element with the xpath mentioned in the error message.
According to the new version of the HTML, the "Post Comment" button has an xpath of "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/button", and it is very likely that the "Post Comment" button referred to in the error message.
So, to fix the test case, simply replace the xpath in the test case that is "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/input" with " /html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/button".

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[2]/textarea').send_keys("test")

...
2024-09-16 16:30:30,568:INFO:The testcase 1-2 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be concluded that the significant change in the structure of the elements in the new version is the root cause of the test failure. However, by comparing the new version of the HTML and the test case, the new version of the HTML still contains elements with similar names and structures to the "shout_message-field" element, and the "Post Comment" button is still present.
At the same time, there are no "Edit" and "Delete" elements in the new version of the HTML.
The error message and xpath in the test case cannot be found in the new version of the HTML, which indicates that the xpath mentioned in the error message is not consistent with the actual xpath in the new version of the HTML.
So, in order to fix the test, you need to change the xpath in the test case to the xpath of the element in the new HTML that is most similar to the one mentioned in the error message.

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 16:30:30,568:INFO:The testcase 1-3 is generated:
According to the understanding of the possible causes of test failure, the "shout_message-field" element has been replaced by a "Leave a Comment" textarea element, and all the sub-elements have been removed.
By looking at the new HTML, we can see that this change is indeed true.
It is very likely that the test case is trying to test the "bold" button, "underline" button, "insert link" button, "insert email" button, and "insert image" button in the "shout_message-field" element, but they are not present in the new version of the HTML. In addition, the "Post Comment" button is still present in the new version of the HTML, and the xpath used in the test case needs to be changed to match the new version of the HTML.
It is also possible that the test case is interacting with the "Manage Comments" element, as the new version of the HTML has a similar element. However, this does not seem to be the main reason for the test failure, as the xpath for the test case in the error message is consistent with the new version of the HTML.
The deletion of the "Edit" and "Delete" elements in the new version of the HTML could not be found in the new version of the HTML.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/button').click()
...

In this repair, the xpath in the test case, which was consistent with the xpath in the error message, was not mentioned in the new version of the HTML, so no changes were made.
In addition, the test case is repaired by removing the xpaths in the test case that contain the "Manage Comments" element and the "Edit" and "Delete" elements, since these elements could not be found in the new version of the HTML, there is no need to test them.
2024-09-16 16:30:30,568:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the "shout_message-field" element has been removed and replaced with a "Leave a Comment" textarea element. It can also be concluded that the "Edit" and "Delete" elements have been removed.
At the same time, by looking at the new HTML source code, it can be found that the structure of the "shoutbox" is very similar to the "Leave a Comment" element, so it is very likely that this element is the "shout_message-field" mentioned in the possible test failure cause.
In addition, the "Edit" and "Delete" elements in the new HTML are contained in the "shoutbox" element, which is very similar to the "Leave a Comment" element.
By looking at the error message and the new HTML, it can be found that the xpath has a part "/div/div/div/input" that cannot be found in the new version, and the new version of the HTML contains a similar "Please select your Rating" element in front of the "Post Comment" element, which is very similar to the description of the error message.
So, to fix the test case, you need to change the xpath of the element that cannot be found to '.../div/button'.
In addition, it can be understood that the subsequent code in the test case is to simulate clicking on the smiley button, bold button, underline button, etc., but these buttons no longer exist in the new version, so the subsequent test case code needs to be deleted.

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_name"])[2]').send_keys("admin")

2024-09-16 16:30:30,568:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be seen that the changes in the "shout_message-field" element and the "Post Comment" button can lead to test failures.
Looking at the new version of the HTML, it is easy to find that the xpath in the error message is not in the new version of the HTML. So it's necessary to find a new element to replace the missing one.
At the same time, the new HTML shows that the "Manage Comments", "Edit" and "Delete" elements are still present, but they are not the main elements of the test case.
To fix this test case, you just need to replace the xpath of the element that caused the error in the test case with one of the elements under "Leave a Comment textarea".
In addition, if you understand the intent of the test case, you can see that the element with xpath '/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/button' is a Post Comment button and the element with xpath '/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div/img[10]' is likely to be one of the elements in the smiley button group.
So in the new version of the HTML, you can find the "Post Comment" button directly and click on it. It is not necessary to click on any smiley button before that.

The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="post_comment"]').click()
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[2]/textarea').send_keys("test")
...

The repaired test case is based on the understanding that the "Post Comment" button is the final button to be clicked in the test case, so the smiley element does not need to be clicked.
The repaired test case still follows the intent of the original test case and maintains the test of the same element.
2024-09-16 16:33:10,696:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
From the comparison of the major elements between the old and new versions, we can see that the "shout_message-field" element and its child elements have been replaced in the new version with different elements related to commenting and rating. This change in the structure of the elements is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

In the old version, the "shout_message-field" element and its child elements were responsible for functionalities such as posting comments, managing comments, inserting links and images, and posting ratings. However, in the new version, these functionalities have been restructured and distributed across different elements like "comment_message," "post_comment," "ratings," and "shout_box."

The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element using an XPath that no longer exists in the new version. This is expected as the structure and identifiers of the elements have been changed, leading to the failure to locate the expected element.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the HTML structure: The overall HTML structure of the page might have been modified in the new version, causing the test case to fail in locating elements based on the old XPath expressions.
2. Renamed or removed elements: Specific elements might have been renamed or removed in the new version, making it difficult for the test case to interact with them using the old identifiers.
3. Functionality reorganization: The functionalities might have been reorganized in the new version, leading to changes in the location and structure of the elements associated with those functionalities.

To address the test case failure, the test scripts need to be updated with the new XPath expressions corresponding to the elements in the new version. Test scripts should be reviewed and modified to reflect the changes in the application's structure and functionality to ensure their compatibility with the updated version.

By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it can be seen that the "shout_message-field" element mentioned in the new version of the HTML is very likely to be the root cause of the test failure. And by comparing the original test case with the new version of the HTML, it can be found that the xpath expression "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/input" is very similar to the one in the error message, which contains the "shout_message-field" element.
So, to fix the test case, you need to replace the "shout_message-field" with the "shout_message" element in the xpath expression in the test case.
In addition, the "shout_message" element in the new HTML appears to be an input box, so in order to get a more accurate location, the "input" label should be removed from the xpath expression in the test case.

The repaired test case is:

Based on the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be understood that the change of the "shout_message-field" element and its related elements is the root cause of the test failure.
However, the new version of the HTML you provided contains the "shout_message-field" element, and it is a <div> tag, not a <form> tag. So the root cause of the test failure is not that the "shout_message-field" element and its related elements were removed, but that the functionality associated with them was moved to another place.
By looking at the new version of the HTML you provided, you can find that the "shout_box" and "post_rating" elements are the elements that are most relevant to the original test case.
So, to fix the test case, just replace the xpath in the test case with one of the two elements mentioned above.

2024-09-16 16:33:24,534:INFO:The testcase 2-3 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be determined that the root cause of the test failure lies in the replacement of the "shout_message-field" element and its child elements.
So it's necessary to find out where in the test case the "shout_message-field" element is and replace it with a more relevant new element.
According to the error message, it can be determined that the test case is about to interact with an input element, and from the new version of the HTML, it can be found that there is a <button> element in front of the "Message" label of the "shout_message-field", which is the same as the XPath expression in the error message, so there is a high possibility that the error is caused by the action performed on this element.
By looking at the subsequent actions in the test case, it can be seen that the test is about to post a comment, and in the new version of the HTML, a button with the text "Post Comment" is found in the <form> element with the "shout_message-field" element.
So to fix the test case, you need to change the XPath of the test code line in the error message to ".../div/button" to ".../form/button", so that the test can simulate the click action on the "Post Comment" button.

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 16:33:24,534:INFO:The testcase 2-4 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be seen that the root cause of the failure is that the "shout_message-field" element is not found, which may be due to the restructuring of the elements related to posting comments and ratings.
By examining the new version of the HTML, I found that the "shout_message-field" element still exists, and I also found the presence of an element with the id "post_comment". This means that the possible root cause of the failure is that the test case tests the behavior of posting comments, but the new version of the HTML contains a test element for posting comments, so it can be considered that the new element interferes with the behavior of the test case.
The error message in the test case indicates that it is unable to locate an element with the XPath of "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/input", which is very similar to the structure of the "post comment" element in the new HTML, and is likely to be the root cause of the test failure.

The repaired test case is to change the xpath in the test case to "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/button" and then run it.
In addition, to prevent the root cause of the failure of this test case, you need to add a test case for the "post comment" element to check if it can be found, and based on the test error message, this test case should be placed before the test case that could not find the element.

2024-09-16 16:33:24,535:INFO:The testcase 2-5 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be seen that the "shout_message-field" element and its child elements have been replaced by the "comment_message" element and its child elements.
By understanding the error message and the new version of HTML, it can be found that the original "shout_box" element has been replaced by a new "post_comment" element.
At the same time, it can be found that the original test case contained an element with the id of "post_rating", but in the new version of HTML, the id of this element is "post_rating", which may also need to be corrected to match the new version of the HTML.

The repaired test case is based on understanding that the "shout_message-field" and "shout_box" elements have been replaced by "comment_message" and "post_comment" elements, respectively, and based on the error message and the new version of the HTML.
The repaired test case shows that the original "shout_message-field" element and its child elements were replaced with "comment_message" and the original "shout_box" element was replaced with "post_comment".
The original test case contains an element with an id of "post_rating", and although the error message does not report that there is an error, it can be seen from the new version of the HTML that the id of the element is "post_rating".
So, in order to avoid potential test errors in the future, the "post_rating" element in the test case should be changed to "post_rating".

The repaired test case retains the test intent and removes the subsequent test steps related to the "shout_message-field" element, which does not appear in the new version of the HTML, to avoid potential test errors.

2024-09-16 16:35:20,488:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify the following changes that could have caused the test case failure along with the root cause:

1. **Change in Comment Elements**:
   - In the old version, the xpath for the first comment's "Reply" textarea was `//*[@id="comment_message-1"]`, whereas in the new version, it changed to `//*[@id="c1"]/div[2]/div[1]/button`.
   - This change could be the root cause of the failure as the test case might be interacting with the comment elements, which have been modified in the new version.

2. **Introduction of Shoutbox Elements**:
   - In the new version, shoutbox elements were introduced such as the shoutbox textarea and corresponding buttons.
   - The error message mentions an element related to the shoutbox (`/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div/img[10]`), indicating that the test case might be interacting with the shoutbox elements.

3. **Removal of Admin Comment Elements**:
   - Elements related to admin comments like "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for admin comments were present in the old version but are not present in the new version.
   - If the test case is interacting with these admin comment elements, their absence in the new version could lead to failures.

4. **Changes in Element Structure**:
   - The structure of elements like "Manage Comments" may have changed slightly in the new version (`//*[@id="_A1"]/div/div[1]/span/a`), affecting the test case functionality.

5. **Introduction of New Reply, Edit, and Delete Elements**:
   - New elements for reply, edit, and delete actions were introduced for comments and shoutbox in the new version (`//*[@id="c1"]/div[2]/div[1]/button`, `//*[@id="c1"]/div[2]/div[2]/button[1]`, etc.).
   - The test case might not have been updated to interact with these new elements, leading to failures.

Considering these changes, the most likely root cause of the test case failure is the modification in the xpath for the first comment's "Reply" textarea. To address the failure, the test case needs to be updated to interact with the new elements introduced in the new version and remove any references to the elements that have been removed or changed.

2024-09-16 16:35:36,087:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
By analyzing the possible causes of test failure, it is found that the new version of the HTML has indeed added the "Shoutbox" feature.
However, the root cause of the test failure is not this. According to the error message, the test cannot find an element under the "Reply" operation of the first comment, and you mentioned in the possible cause of the test failure that the xpath for this element has been changed. But in the new HTML, it can be clearly seen that the "Reply" button is present, which is also consistent with the error message mentioning that the test cannot find the "Reply" button.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the root cause of the test failure is that the test case wants to click the "Reply" button of the first comment and cannot find it. In the new HTML, you can find the xpath of this element as "//*[@id="shout3"]/div[2]/a[1]", which is consistent with the understanding of the possible root causes of test failure.
So to fix the test case, you need to replace the xpath of the first comment "Reply" element with "//*[@id="shout3"]/div[2]/a[1]".

Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be found that, although the "Reply" element of the first comment was mentioned, there is no such element in the new version of HTML. In addition, the analysis suggests that the xpath of the "Edit" and "Delete" elements has changed, which can also be confirmed in the new version of the HTML.
By analyzing the error message and the new HTML, you can find that the xpath in the error message is part of the xpath of the "Edit" and "Delete" elements of the first comment, which can be found in the new HTML, but not the 10th <img> label. So, to fix the test case, you need to remove the "/div/img[10]" at the end of the xpath mentioned in the error message.
At the same time, it can be found that the id in the xpath of the subsequent test cases has changed in the new version of HTML and the xpath of the "Post Comment" button in front of it has also changed, so all of them need to be updated.
In addition, the "Manage Comments" link in the new version of the HTML is not consistent with the one mentioned in the possible root cause analysis, so it is believed that there are changes in elements that are not closely related to the test case.
The test case can be fixed by replacing the "Reply" element in the xpath with "Post Comment" and deleting the "/div/img[10]" at the end of the xpath, and updating the subsequent test case according to the new HTML.

Based on the understanding of the possible causes of test failure, it can be inferred that the test case failed because the "Edit" and "Delete" elements for the admin comment were removed in the new version, and the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons are mentioned in the error message.
At the same time, the new version of the HTML contains the "Leave a Comment" and "Post Comment" elements for the first comment, which is the same type of element as the "Reply" and "Post Comment" mentioned in the possible cause of test failure, so the root cause should not be in the first comment.
So, to fix the test case, you need to remove the test steps in the test case that contain the xpath in the error message, and add a check to verify that the test case does not report an error when it encounters the "Leave a Comment" element.
The test case you provided can be fixed by deleting the line of code that contains the xpath mentioned in the error message and then rerunning it. Based on the understanding of the possible causes of test failure, the root cause of the failure is the removal of the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons, so if there are other test steps in the test case that interact with these elements, they should also be deleted.

2024-09-16 16:35:36,087:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
Based on the new HTML, the root cause of the test case failure is likely to be due to the addition of the new shoutbox element. The test case in the new version tries to click on an image in the shoutbox, but there are only three <img> elements in the new version of the HTML, so the index in the xpath is out of range.
In order to fix the test case, the action of clicking on the image in the shoutbox should be changed to clicking on the "Save shout" button, because the "Save shout" button is an interactive element, while the <img> elements are not.
At the same time, the line of test code in the error message and the subsequent line of code contain "form", "button" and other interactive elements, so in order to prevent similar errors in the future, the subsequent test code should also be checked to see if it needs to be corrected.
According to the possible causes of test failure, it is found that the change in the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons is also related to the test case and it is likely to cause a failure.
However, in the new version of HTML, the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons are still present, so it is not a cause of test failure, but it could be a potential cause of misunderstanding.
The possible change in the "Reply" element is also mentioned as a possible cause of failure, and it is indeed a change in the test line of code in the error message. However, the xpath in the error message is "//*[@method='xpath','selector']=" which is not consistent with the new test case line of code, and it is not mentioned in the new version of HTML. It can be seen from the new HTML that the id of the "Reply" button for the first comment is "post_comment-1", and it has a higher priority than the other buttons in the xpath.
The new xpath is '.../div[2]/form/div/div[1]/div/button[1]', and the corresponding line of test code in the test case is "test case" + "test" + "test" + "Reply" + "test" + "test", so the probability of this change in the new version of HTML being a cause of test failure is very low.

By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the root cause of this test failure is that the structure of the comment element has changed. In the new version of the HTML, the "Reply" button for the first comment in the article is at xpath '//*[@id="c1"]/div[2]/div[1]/button'.
At the same time, the error message is also mentioning an element related to the shoutbox, but from the new version of the HTML, the xpath in the error message is not found in the new version of the HTML, so it is not the root cause.
In addition, it can be seen from the new version of the HTML that there are "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for comments in the article, so the removal of the admin comment element is not the cause of the test failure.
By understanding the xpath in the test case and the error message, it can be inferred that the test case is to add a comment to a post. Therefore, there is no need to update the test case to interact with the "Reply" button for the first comment in the article, as this is not relevant to the test intent.
In order to fix the test, you just need to update the xpath in the test case to "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li/div[2]/form/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div/img[10]" mentioned in the error message to "/html/body/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/article/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/ul/li[1]/div[2]/div[3]/small/a[1]".

2024-09-16 16:37:21,385:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element related to "Edit" and "Delete" actions for comments has changed significantly. In the old version, these actions were identified using specific xpaths for admin comments, while in the new version, the actions are more generic with xpaths related to individual comments.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The most likely root cause of the test case failure based on the error message provided is the removal of the specific xpaths for "Edit" and "Delete" actions for admin comments in the new version. The error message indicates that the test script is trying to locate an element using an xpath that no longer exists in the new version, leading to a NoSuchElementException.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in Comment Structure: The structure of comments and related elements such as "Reply" may have changed in the new version, causing the test script to fail when trying to interact with these elements.
2. Shoutbox Element Changes: The addition of new elements related to the shoutbox feature in the new version may have affected the overall xpath hierarchy, leading to element location issues.
3. Dynamic Element Positioning: If the order or positioning of elements on the page has changed between versions, it could result in xpath mismatches and element not found errors during test execution.
4. Incorrect XPath Handling: The test script may not have been updated to reflect the changes in xpaths between versions, leading to element location failures.

Recommendation:
To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the changes in element identification between the old and new versions. Specifically, the xpaths for interacting with comments, shoutbox elements, and other related actions should be reviewed and modified accordingly to ensure accurate element location during test execution. Additionally, considering more robust element identification strategies such as using unique IDs or classes where possible can help improve the stability of the test script across version updates.

Based on the analysis of the possible reasons for test failure, it can be seen that the changes in the comment-related elements have a great impact on the test. At the same time, the error message also mentioned that it is impossible to find the element, which also verifies this point.
By looking up the new HTML, I found that the "Edit" and "Delete" actions were removed, but there is no indication that this has caused a problem. This is because the xpath in the test case is actually trying to find the 10th <img> tag in a sequence of elements, which does not exist in the new version of the HTML.
Based on the xpath in the test case and the new version of the HTML, I found that the root cause of the failure of this test case is that the xpath contains an 'img' element with a subscript of 10, but the new version of the HTML only has 9 'img' elements in the same hierarchical structure.
So, to fix this test case, you just need to change the "10" in the xpath to "9".

Based on the error message and new version of HTML, it can be inferred that the test script tries to click on the "Delete" element of a comment.
In the new version of the HTML, it can be seen that the "Edit" and "Delete" actions are placed in the same "div" tag, so the "Edit" and "Delete" elements should be siblings.
In the new version of the HTML, it is clear that there are only two <img> tags, so if the test script wants to click on the tenth <img> tag, it will definitely report an error.
So the root cause of the error is that the xpath is not accurate enough to locate the "Edit" and "Delete" elements, and in order to fix the error, the xpath needs to be changed to "//*[@id="_A1"]/div[2]/a[3]".

It is not necessary to change the xpath in the error message, because the reported xpath does not exist in the new version of the HTML and so it is not possible to find the element based on it.
