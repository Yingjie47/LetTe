Test Intent: 
The test case AddMultipleAreaTest.java is intended to test the functionality of adding multiple areas in an application. 

Test Case Operation Intent: 
1. The test case sets up the environment by launching the Chrome browser, navigating to a specified base URL, and logging in as an administrator user.
2. The test case then proceeds to add two areas sequentially by entering the names "Area New1" and "Area New2" into the input field with the name "name" and clicking the "Add Area" button for each area.
3. After adding the areas, the test case verifies that the first area "Area New1" was successfully added by checking if the text matches the expected value.

Overall, the test case aims to validate the functionality of adding multiple areas and ensuring that the added areas appear correctly on the page.

2024-10-31 09:17:28,453:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Name" element in the old version has been removed in the new version. This removal is the root cause of the test case failure as indicated by the error message stating that it is unable to locate the element with xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]".

Root Cause:
1. The "Name" element with xpath "/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input" in the old version has been replaced with "Name:" element with xpath "//*[@id="NewUserName"]" in the new version.
2. The test case is trying to locate the "Name" element using the old xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]", which no longer exists in the new version. This results in a NoSuchElement exception as the element cannot be found.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in element locators: The xpath locators for "Password" and "Log in" elements have also been updated in the new version. If the test case is using the old xpaths for these elements, it will also fail to locate them.
2. Changes in element attributes: The attributes of the elements such as IDs have been updated in the new version. If the test case is using outdated attributes to locate the elements, it will result in test case failure.

Recommendation:
To fix the test case failure, update the test case to use the new xpaths for the elements "Name:", "Password:", and "Log in". Ensure that the test case is using up-to-date element locators and attributes to interact with the elements in the new version of the web application.

2024-10-31 09:18:31,166:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the key change that led to the test case failure is the removal of the "Log in" button element from the old version to the new version. 

In the old version:
- "Log in" xpath="/html/body/form/input[4]"

In the new version:
- "Log in" xpath="//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input"

The error message specifically states that it is unable to locate the element with xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]". This corresponds to the "Log in" button in the old version. Since the "Log in" button element was removed in the new version, the test case failed due to the absence of this critical element for the login functionality.

Root cause of test case failure:
- Removal of the "Log in" button element in the new version led to the test case failure as the script was trying to locate this element which no longer exists in the updated version.

Other possible reasons for test case failure:
- Changes in element locators: The xpath for "Name" and "Password" elements also changed in the new version, which might have impacted the test case execution if the locators were not updated accordingly.
- Changes in element attributes: Any changes in the attributes of the elements such as IDs, classes, etc., could also lead to test case failures if not updated in the test scripts.
- Changes in the DOM structure: Structural changes in the DOM could also impact the element locators and result in test case failures.

In summary, the main reason for the test case failure is the removal of the "Log in" button element in the new version, causing the script to be unable to locate the element during execution. Other reasons include changes in element locators, attributes, and DOM structure that were not accounted for in the test scripts.

2024-10-31 09:19:27,580:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
In comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Name" element in the old version with the xpath "/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input" has been replaced by the "Name:" element in the new version with the xpath "//*[@id="NewUserName"]". 

Given the error message that the test case failed due to the inability to locate the element with xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]", it is clear that the "Name" element in the old version was the root cause of the failure. The removal of the "Name" element from the old version and its replacement with a new element in the new version led to the test case trying to locate an element that no longer exists, resulting in the NoSuchElement exception.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the form: The new version may have restructured the form elements, leading to changes in the xpath of the elements, causing the test case to fail.
2. Changes in element identifiers: The switch from using a specific xpath in the old version to using IDs in the new version can impact test case execution if not updated accordingly.
3. Changes in element attributes: The attributes of the elements (e.g., name, id) might have been modified or updated in the new version, causing the test case to fail when trying to locate them using the old attributes.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to use the new element identifiers and xpaths from the new version of the web application. This involves updating the locators in the test script to match the new version's structure and elements, ensuring that the test case can locate and interact with the correct elements during execution.

Test Intent: The test case AddMultipleAreaTest.java is intended to test the functionality of adding multiple areas in an application. 

Test Case Operation Intent:
1. The setup method sets up the test environment by launching the Chrome browser, navigating to a specific URL, and logging in as an administrator.
2. The test method addMultipleAreaTest() performs the following steps:
   a. Adds an area named "Area New1".
   b. Adds another area named "Area New2".
   c. Verifies that the first area "Area New1" was successfully added by checking if it is displayed on the page.

Overall, the test case focuses on adding multiple areas and verifying the successful addition of at least one area.

2024-10-31 09:23:21,397:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the first noticeable change is the XPath for the element "07:00". In the old version, the XPath was `//*[@id="test_table"]/tbody/tr[2]/td[1]/table/tbody/tr/td/center/a`, while in the new version, it changed to `//*[@id="day_main"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/div/a`.

Given that the error message indicates a `NoSuchElementException` for the element with the XPath `//a[text()='Admin']`, it's likely that the first change in the XPath for the "07:00" element is the root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the web page: The IDs and structure of the elements might have been altered in the new version, leading to elements not being located correctly by the test script.
  
2. Changes in the element properties: The attributes or properties of the elements might have been modified in the new version, causing the test script to fail in locating and interacting with them.

3. Timing issues: If the test script relies on specific timing or order of elements loading on the page, changes in the new version that affect the timing of element rendering could result in test failures.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to use the new XPaths for the elements in the new version of the web application. Additionally, it's essential to verify if there are any other structural or property changes in the elements that might impact the test script's functionality.

Test Intent: The test case AddMultipleAreaTest.java is designed to test the functionality of adding multiple areas on a web application. 

Test Case Operation Intent: The test case first sets up the environment by logging in as an administrator and navigating to the "Rooms" section of the application. Then, it proceeds to add two new areas by entering the names "Area New1" and "Area New2" into the "Name" text field and clicking on the "Add Area" button for each. 

After adding the areas, the test case verifies if the first area "Area New1" was successfully added by checking if it is displayed on the page. The test case includes an assertion to verify the presence of "Area New1" on the page.

Overall, the main intent of this test case is to ensure that the functionality of adding multiple areas works correctly on the web application.

2024-10-31 09:29:02,695:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the main elements of the old and new versions, it is evident that the "Area New1" element present in the old version is not found in the new version. The error message indicates that the test case is trying to locate an element with the xpath "//a[text()='Area New1']" but it is unable to find it, resulting in a "NoSuchElementException".

The removal of the "Area New1" element is likely the root cause of the test case failure. Since the test case is looking for this element and it no longer exists in the new version, the test cannot proceed as expected, leading to the NoSuchElementException.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in element locators: The xpath values for elements such as "Name:", "Add Area", "Name:", "Description:", "Capacity:", and "Add Room" have changed in the new version. If the test case is using these outdated xpaths, it will not be able to locate the elements correctly, leading to failures.
2. Changes in element functionality: The functionality associated with elements like "Change", "Edit", and "Delete" might differ from the previous version. If the test case is interacting with these elements in a way that is no longer valid in the new version, it could cause failures.
3. Changes in the overall page structure: The structure of the page where these elements reside may have changed significantly between versions. If the test case relies on a specific page layout or structure that has been altered, it can result in failures.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the correct element locators and interactions based on the new version of the web application. Additionally, any dependencies on removed elements or outdated functionalities should be revised to align with the changes in the application.
