2024-10-28 22:26:19,680:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old version with the new version, the following changes are noted:

1. "Username" changed to "User name" with xpath modification.
2. "Enter" xpath changed significantly.
3. "Search from keyword" element is removed in the new version.
4. "Search" element is removed in the new version.
5. "CS212 - Computer Science" element is added in the new version.

From the error message provided, the main issue causing the test case failure is related to the "Enter" button. The error message indicates that the element with the CSS selector "button[type="submit"]" could not be located. This aligns with the change in the xpath for the "Enter" button between the old and new versions. In the old version, the xpath for the "Enter" button was "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/fieldset/button", while in the new version, it changed to "//*[@id="loginBox"]/div/form/fieldset/input". This difference in the xpath caused the test case to fail as the test script was unable to locate the element using the new xpath.

Additionally, the removal of the "Search from keyword" and "Search" elements in the new version might also affect the test case if the test script interacts with these elements.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to reflect the new xpath for the "Enter" button and any other elements that have changed or been removed in the new version of the web application. This update will ensure that the test script can locate and interact with the elements correctly, resolving the test case failure.
