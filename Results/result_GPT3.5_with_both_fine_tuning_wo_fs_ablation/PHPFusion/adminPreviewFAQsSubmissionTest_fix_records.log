2024-09-16 22:52:01,919:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the following significant changes have occurred:

1. The "Preview" button in the old version has been replaced by a new "Preview" button in the new version with a different XPath.
2. The "Publish" button in the old version has been replaced by a new "Publish" button in the new version with a different XPath.
3. The "Delete" button in the old version has been replaced by a new "Delete" button in the new version with a different XPath.
4. The "Category" field in the old version has been modified in the new version, and now it requires an additional click on the anchor tag.
5. The "Visibility" field in the old version has been modified in the new version, and now it requires an additional click on the anchor tag.
6. The "Language" field in the old version has been modified in the new version.
7. The "Date" field in the old version has been retained in the new version.
8. The "Preview" button in the old version has been replaced by a new "Preview" button in the new version with a different XPath.
9. The "Publish" button in the old version has been replaced by a new "Publish" button in the new version with a different XPath.
10. The "Delete" button in the old version has been replaced by a new "Delete" button in the new version with a different XPath.

Based on the error message provided, "selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//*[@id="preview_submission-formstart"]"}", it is clear that the test case is failing because the old XPath for the "Preview" button is no longer present in the new version of the application. This change in XPath for the "Preview" button is likely the root cause of the test case failure.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the structure of the web page, modifications in the naming conventions of elements, or updates in the functionality of the application that have not been accounted for in the test case script.

To address the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the new XPaths for the "Preview," "Publish," and "Delete" buttons, as well as any other elements that have changed in the new version of the application. Additionally, it is recommended to review and update the test script to accommodate any other modifications that may have been made to the application.

2024-09-16 22:52:14,282:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be determined that the new "Preview", "Publish", and "Delete" buttons have been changed, and by looking up the new version of the HTML source code, it can be found that these elements are indeed contained in the new test page, and that the XPath for the "Preview" button is "//*[@id="preview_submission"]", the XPath for the "Publish" button is "//*[@id="publish_submission"]", and the XPath for the "Delete" button is "//*[@id="delete_submission"]".
It can be seen that the change of the "Category" and "Visibility" fields is irrelevant to the test case.
At the same time, by understanding the possible causes of test failure, it can be inferred that the "Date" field in the old version of the new version has been retained, and by looking up the new version of the HTML source code, it is found that this is true.
So in order to fix the test case, you need to replace '//*[@id="preview_submission-formstart"]' in the test script with '//*[@id="preview_submission"]'.
At the same time, based on the error message and the possible test failure reasons you provided, it can be inferred that the "Preview", "Publish", and "Delete" buttons have been changed and therefore need to be modified as well.
Also, in order to prevent similar errors from happening in the future, the "Date" field in the test code should be changed to the new version's XPath.

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 22:52:14,282:INFO:The testcase 1-2 is generated:
By understanding the possible causes of test failure, it is clear that the "Preview", "Publish" and "Delete" buttons have changed, and by understanding the new version of the HTML, it can be found that all of the three buttons have been wrapped in a <form> tag, which may have changed the way they work, or they may have become sub-elements.
According to the understanding of the possible causes of test failure, it can be found that the "Category" and "Visibility" fields have changed, and by understanding the new version of the HTML, it can be found that they all have a new "select" tag as a child element, and the xpath mentioned in the test case is consistent with the error message.
In order to test the "Preview" button in the new version of the HTML, the xpath in the test case can be simply changed to '//*[@id="preview_submission"]'.
To test the "Publish" button, the xpath in the test case can be simply changed to '//*[@id="publish_submission"]'.
To test the "Delete" button, the xpath in the test case can be simply changed to '//*[@id="delete_submission"]'.
In order to test the "Category" and "Visibility" fields, since the xpath mentioned in the test case is consistent with the error message, I do not think it needs to be tested. But you can add some test code to test the new "select" tag.

2024-09-16 22:52:14,282:INFO:The testcase 1-3 is generated:
By analyzing the possible reasons for test failure, it is found that the "Preview", "Publish", "Delete" buttons and "Category", "Visibility", "Language" fields have been changed in the new version. According to the new version of the HTML, the root cause of this test failure is that the "Publish" button has been removed, and the "Preview" and "Delete" buttons have been moved to the right side of the table and are no longer in the position that can be directly found in the path of '//*[@id="faq_preview-Modal"]/div/div/div[1]/button'.
The new version of the HTML has indeed added an <a> tag in front of the "Category" field, so the "Category" field has to be clicked to find the element in the test case xpath.
Similarly, the new version of the HTML has indeed added an <a> tag in front of the "Visibility" field, so the "Visibility" field has to be clicked to find the element in the test case xpath.

2024-09-16 22:52:14,282:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for test failure, it is known that the "Preview", "Publish" and "Delete" buttons have been replaced, and by observing the new HTML it can be found that the "Preview" button has not been changed, but the "Publish" and "Delete" buttons have been moved outside the form and become ordinary buttons, and their XPath is different from the old version.
In addition, the "Category", "Visibility", "Language" and "Date" fields are all present and have not been changed.
It can be understood that the intent of the test case is to verify the successful submission of a form by clicking the "Preview" button. However, it did not verify whether the form was submitted successfully, but directly verified the click event of the "Preview" button, and only by the way, verified whether the new form was displayed.
So in order to better test the intent of the test case, it is necessary to change the XPath of the "Preview" button in the test code to the "Publish" or "Delete" button mentioned in the error message, and if you want to keep the original test intention, you can first check the form submission status after clicking the "Preview" button, and then check the display of the new form.
At the same time, to prevent the same error message from reappearing, it is necessary to change the XPath of the "Preview" button in the subsequent test code so that it can still be located correctly.
And, there is an "Add New Question" button in the new HTML, which has an id of "faq_question-addquestion". It is likely that there is a test intent in this test case that needs to click this button, so it is necessary to test this in the new version.
The repaired test case is:
...
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="faq_preview-Modal"]/div/div/div[1]/button').click()
# sleep(1)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="faq_question-addquestion"]').click()

2024-09-16 22:52:14,282:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure, it is clear that the new version of HTML has added a "Delete" button, and the "Category" and "Visibility" fields have been modified to require an additional click on the anchor tag.
In the new version of HTML, I couldn't find the "Language" field, so it might be a field that has been deleted.
By understanding the error message, I know that the "Preview" button in the new version of HTML is id = "preview_submission", so the new version of HTML should not have a "Publish" button and a "Delete" button.
So to fix the test case, you only need to change '//*[@id="preview_submission-formstart"]' to '//*[@id="preview_submission"]'.
