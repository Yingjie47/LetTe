5. Clicks on the "Manage administrator email notifications" link.
6. Verifies that the text "System mail : recipients list" is present on the page.
7. Clicks on a submit button.

**Test Case Operation Intent:**

The test case operation intent is to verify the functionality related to managing administrator email notifications in the web application. The test aims to ensure that the user can access the email notification settings for administrators and that the expected text is displayed on the page. The test also verifies the behavior of clicking on the submit button after making changes to the email notification settings.

Overall, the test focuses on the functionality and user interface related to managing administrator email notifications in the web application.

2024-10-28 22:43:59,649:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old version with the new version, the following changes are observed:

1. "Username" changed to "User name"
2. "Enter" xpath changed significantly
3. "Search from keyword" element is removed
4. "Search" button element is removed
5. "CS212 - Computer Science" element is added

Based on the error message provided:
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"button[type="submit"]"}

The key change that is likely causing the test case failure is the removal of the "Enter" button. In the old version, the "Enter" button was located using the xpath "//*[@id="claroPage"]/div[2]/div[1]/div/form/fieldset/button", while in the new version, the xpath has changed to "//*[@id="loginBox"]/div/form/fieldset/input[3]". This change in the xpath for the "Enter" button is the primary reason for the "no such element" exception when the test case is executed.

Additionally, the removal of the "Search" button element might also impact the test case if it was interacting with the search functionality.

To address this test case failure, the test script needs to be updated to interact with the new "Enter" button element using the correct xpath from the new version of the application. Additionally, any interactions with the "Search" button need to be adjusted based on the changes in the new version.

In summary, the primary reason for the test case failure is the change in the xpath for the "Enter" button element from the old version to the new version, leading to the inability to locate the element during the test execution.
