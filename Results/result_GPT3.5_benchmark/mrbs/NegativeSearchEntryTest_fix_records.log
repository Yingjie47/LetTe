2024-11-01 11:37:12,936:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
The root cause of the test case failure is likely due to the change in the xpath for the "Log in" element between the old and new versions of the web application.

In the old version:
- "Log in" xpath="//*[@value=" Log in "]"

In the new version:
- "Log in" xpath="//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input"

The error message indicates that the test is trying to locate the element using the xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]", which does not exist in either the old or new versions. This suggests that the test script was not updated to reflect the changes in the element locators between the versions.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the HTML code: If the structure of the HTML code surrounding the elements has changed significantly between the versions, it could also lead to element locators not being found.
2. Changes in the attributes of the elements: If the attributes of the elements (e.g., id, name, value) have been modified or removed in the new version, the test script needs to be updated accordingly to locate the elements correctly.
3. Changes in the naming convention: The change from using the "name" attribute in the old version to using the "id" attribute in the new version could also lead to test case failures if not accounted for in the test script.

In conclusion, the test case failed due to the test script not being updated to reflect the changes in the element locators between the old and new versions of the web application, specifically the xpath for the "Log in" element.

2024-11-01 11:37:52,335:INFO:Cause of failure 2 generated:
The main elements of the old version and the new version have the following differences:

1. "Name" xpath="//*[@name="NewUserName"]" (old version) vs "Name:" xpath="//*[@id="NewUserName"]" (new version)
2. "Password" xpath="//*[@name="NewUserPassword"]" (old version) vs "Password:" xpath="//*[@id="NewUserPassword"]" (new version)
3. "Log in" xpath="//*[@value=" Log in "]" (old version) vs "Log in" xpath="//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input" (new version)

Based on the error message provided, it seems that the test case failed because it was unable to locate the element with xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]". This xpath does not match any of the major elements listed for either the old or new versions. However, it is possible that the xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]" was used in the test case but it was not one of the major elements being compared.

As mentioned in the note, the first element that was removed is likely the root cause of the test case failure. In this case, the "Name" element was removed in the new version, and the xpath for "Name:" has changed from "//*[@name="NewUserName"]" to "//*[@id="NewUserName"]". This change in element identification is the likely cause of the failure as the test case was looking for the old element that no longer exists in the new version.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include changes in the structure of the HTML code, modifications to the application's backend logic, or incorrect handling of dynamic elements during the test execution. It is important to review the test case thoroughly and update it to reflect the changes in the new version of the web application to ensure its successful execution.

2024-11-01 11:38:04,944:INFO:Cause of failure 3 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, the main difference is the change in the xpath for the "Log in" button. In the old version, the xpath for the "Log in" button was `//*[@value=" Log in "]`, while in the new version, it is `//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input`.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The error message `org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException` indicates that the test case failed because the test script could not locate the element using the specified xpath `/html/body/form/input[3]`. This xpath was likely used to locate the "Log in" button in the old version of the application. However, as per the provided major elements, the xpath for the "Log in" button in the new version is different (`//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input`), which caused the test script to fail as it was unable to find the element with the old xpath.

Other Possible Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in element locators: Apart from the "Log in" button, there could have been changes in the locators of other elements such as "Name" and "Password" fields. If the test script is using outdated locators for these elements, it could lead to test case failures.
  
2. Changes in element attributes: The attributes of the elements like IDs, names, or values might have been updated in the new version. If the test script is using outdated attributes to identify elements, it can result in failures.
  
3. Changes in element structure: The overall structure of the web page might have been modified in the new version, leading to changes in the hierarchy or placement of elements. This can cause the test script to fail if it is relying on specific element positions or parent-child relationships.

Recommendation:
To address the test case failure, update the test script with the correct xpaths for all major elements based on the new version of the application. Regularly maintain and review the test scripts to ensure they are aligned with the current version of the web application to avoid such failures in the future.

To be updated to:

```java
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@value=' Log in ']")).click();
```

Explanation: The failing statement is attempting to locate and click the "Log in" button using an outdated xpath `/html/body/form/input[3]`. The correct xpath for the "Log in" button in the new version is `/html/body/div[1]/table/tbody/tr/td[6]/div/form/div/input`, however, the fix was not successful. Since the provided information indicates that the xpath for the "Log in" button in the new version is `//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input`, the correct xpath should be updated to `//input[@value=' Log in ']` to align with the new version of the application.

1. Set up the test environment by logging in as an administrator.
2. Click on the "Search:" link on the page.
3. Clear the search input field.
4. Enter an empty string in the search input field.
5. Click the "Search" button.
6. Wait for the result to load.

2024-11-01 11:41:37,109:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can identify that the "goto" element from the old version is missing in the new version. This is likely the root cause of the test case failure, as indicated by the error message mentioning an inability to locate an element with an xpath that seems related to the missing "goto" element.

Other changes in the elements include:
- The "Search:" element in the old version has been replaced by "Search For:" in the new version, with a different xpath.
- The input field for search in the old version has been updated to a new element with a different xpath in the new version.
- The "Print Preview" element from the old version is not present in the new version.

Possible reasons for the test case failure:
1. Missing element: The removal of the "goto" element from the new version is the primary reason for the test case failure, as the test case is likely trying to interact with this element which no longer exists.
2. Element structure changes: The structure of the "Search" and search input elements has changed in the new version, causing the test case to fail when interacting with these elements.
3. Additional element removal: The absence of the "Print Preview" element in the new version could also impact the test case if it interacts with this element.

Recommendation:
To address the test case failure, update the test case to interact with the new elements in the new version of the web application. Specifically, modify the test steps related to the missing "goto" element and adjust interactions with the updated "Search For:" and "Search" elements. Additionally, remove any steps related to the "Print Preview" element to align with the changes in the new version.
