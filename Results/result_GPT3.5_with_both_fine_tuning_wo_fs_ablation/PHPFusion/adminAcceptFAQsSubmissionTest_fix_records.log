2024-09-16 22:54:47,853:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see the following changes:

1. "¡Á" is removed from the new version.
2. The xpaths for elements such as Preview, Publish, Delete, etc., have changed in the new version.
3. The structure of the elements has been simplified in the new version with more user-friendly IDs.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
The error message indicates that the XPath used to locate the element with the ID "publish_submission-formend" was not found. This element is not present in the list of major elements for either the old or the new version. However, it seems like the XPath used in the test case script is incorrect or outdated. It's possible that this XPath was present in the old version but was changed or removed in the new version, leading to the test case failure.

Other Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in Element Locators: The test cases are likely failing because the element locators used in the test scripts are not updated to match the new structure of the web application in the new version. Elements such as Preview, Publish, Delete, etc., have new xpaths in the new version which need to be updated in the test scripts.

2. Missing Elements: Some elements like "¡Á" have been removed in the new version, which could also cause test cases to fail if they were being interacted with in the test scripts.

3. Different Element IDs: The new version has introduced new IDs for elements such as Question, Answer, Category, etc. If the test scripts are still using old IDs from the previous version, they will fail to locate these elements in the new version.

To resolve the test case failures:
1. Update the test scripts with the correct and updated element locators based on the new version's structure.
2. Ensure that the test scripts are using the latest IDs and xpaths for interacting with the elements.
3. Regularly maintain and update the test scripts to align with any changes in the web application to prevent future failures.

2024-09-16 22:54:57,535:INFO:The testcase 1-1 is generated:
Based on the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be concluded that the id of the element with the text "Publish" has been changed.
By observing the new version of the HTML we can see that the id of the "Publish" button is "publish_submission".
So to fix the failing test case, just change '//*[@id="publish_submission-formend"]' to '//*[@id="publish_submission"]'.

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_name"])[2]').send_keys("admin")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '(//*[@name="user_pass"])[2]').send_keys("admin123")

2024-09-16 22:54:57,535:INFO:The testcase 1-2 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure, we can understand that in the new version of the HTML, the id for the "Publish" button element has changed to "publish_submission", which is consistent with the error message in the test case, and the "¡Á" element has been removed, which does not affect this test case.
At the same time, by looking at the new version of the HTML, we can find that there is no element with the id "faq_admin", but there is a "faqs" element, which is more in line with the test case.
So, to fix the test case, you just need to replace "//*[@id="faq_admin"]/li[2]/a" with "//*[@id="faqs"]/li[2]/a".

The repaired test case is:
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://localhost/PHPFusion-9.10.30/")

2024-09-16 22:54:57,535:INFO:The testcase 1-3 is generated:
By understanding the possible reasons for the test failure, it can be seen that the element with the ID "Publish" has changed, but after looking through the new version of the HTML, it can be found that this is not true.
So the root cause of the test failure is that the element with the ID "publish_submission" cannot be found, and after checking the new version of the HTML, there is no such element with the ID in it. However, there is a "Preview" element that has a similar meaning to "publish_submission".
So to fix the test case, you need to change '//*[@id="publish_submission-formend"]' to '//*[@id="preview_submission"]'.

2024-09-16 22:54:57,535:INFO:The testcase 1-4 is generated:
According to the analysis of the possible causes of test failure, it can be known that the root cause of the failure of this test case is that the "¡Á" element was removed in the new version, and the error information is related to the "publish" element. By checking the new version of the HTML, it is found that the "¡Á" element has indeed been removed, and the corresponding "¡Á" element in the old version of the test case can be found in the new version of the HTML. At the same time, the "Publish" element is now "Publish Submission".
The element with id "admin_password" in the test case does not exist in the new version of the HTML, but it is not reported as an error in the test, which is why it is not mentioned in the test error analysis.
At the same time, by examining the new version of HTML, it can be seen that the id of the "Preview" element is "preview_submission", the id of the "Publish" element is "publish_submission", and the id of the "Delete" element is "delete_submission".

The repaired test case is:

2024-09-16 22:54:57,535:INFO:The testcase 1-5 is generated:
It can be seen that the XPath in the test case that caused the failure is "//*[@id="publish_submission-formend"]", which is very similar to the XPath you mentioned in the new version of the HTML (such as "Publish", "Delete" and other elements). It's just that the ID of the element is "publish_submission" in the new version, not "publish_submission-formend". So, to fix the test case, you just need to change the XPath in the test case to "//*[@id="publish_submission"]".
At the same time, I noticed that there is an element whose ID is "admin_password" in the test case, and you mentioned that some new user-friendly IDs have been introduced in the new version. So you can try to change the "admin_password" in the test case to "faq_answer-insertimage".
There is also an element whose ID is "admin-login-form" in the test case, and you mentioned that some new user-friendly IDs have been introduced in the new version. So you can try to change the "admin-login-form" in the test case to "submissionform".

The repaired test case is:
