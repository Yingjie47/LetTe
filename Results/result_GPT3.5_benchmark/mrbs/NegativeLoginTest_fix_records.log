Test Intent: 

The test case NegativeLoginTest.java is a negative test case designed to verify the behavior of the system when a user tries to log in with incorrect credentials. 

Test Case Operation Intent:
1. The test case sets up the WebDriver for Chrome and navigates to the specified base URL.
2. In the negativeLoginTest() method:
   a. It locates the "Log in" button and clicks on it without entering any username or password.
   b. It then enters the admin username and an incorrect password.
   c. Clicks on the login button again.
   d. Checks if the error message "Unknown user" is displayed on the page.
   e. If the error message is displayed, the test passes; otherwise, it will throw an assertion error.

This test case is verifying that the system correctly handles the scenario where a user tries to log in with incorrect credentials and that the appropriate error message is displayed.

2024-11-01 11:18:13,263:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the element for "Name" has changed in the new version. In the old version, the "Name" field was located using the xpath "/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input", while in the new version, it is located using the xpath "//*[@id="NewUserName"]".

The error message states that the test case failed to locate the element using the xpath "/html/body/form/input[3]". This corresponds to the "Log in" button in the old version, which has changed in the new version to "//*[@id="logon_submit"]/input".

The root cause of the test case failure is that the xpath for the "Log in" button was not updated to match the new version. The test case is still trying to locate the element using the old xpath, which is no longer valid in the new version of the application.

Other reasons for the test case failure could include:
1. Changes in the structure of the HTML code between the old and new versions.
2. Changes in the naming conventions of elements in the new version.
3. Changes in the positioning of elements on the webpage.

To fix the test case, you need to update the xpath for the "Log in" button to match the new version of the application. This should resolve the NoSuchElementException and allow the test case to locate and interact with the element successfully.

Test Intent: 

The test case NegativeLoginTest.java is designed to test the scenario where a user tries to log in with incorrect credentials and expects to see an error message "Unknown user" displayed on the page.

Test Case Operation Intent:
1. Set up the test environment by launching the Chrome browser and navigating to the specified base URL.
2. Perform a negative login test by clicking the "Log in" button without entering any username and password.
3. Enter the username (Constants.ADMIN_USER_NAME) and an incorrect password ("jdwdj").
4. Click the login button.
5. Verify that the error message "Unknown user" is displayed on the page (located at xpath "/html/body/p[1]").
6. The test is expected to fail (Assert error) as the actual message is compared against the expected "Unknown user" message.

Overall, the test case aims to validate the system's behavior when a user attempts to log in with invalid credentials and checks if the appropriate error message is shown on the page.

2024-11-01 11:21:18,497:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Name" element in the old version with the xpath "/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input" has been replaced by the "Name:" element in the new version with the xpath "//*[@id="NewUserName"]".

Based on the error message provided, the root cause of the test case failure is likely that the test script is still trying to locate the old "Name" element using the xpath "/html/body/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input", which no longer exists in the new version. This is indicated by the error message stating that it is unable to locate the element with xpath "/html/body/p[1]".

The other reasons for the test case failure could be:
1. Incorrect xpaths: The xpaths used in the test script may not be updated to match the new elements in the new version of the application.
2. Changes in element properties: The properties of the elements such as IDs, classes, or other attributes may have changed in the new version, causing the test script to fail to locate them.
3. Changes in element hierarchy: The structure of the HTML elements may have been modified in the new version, leading to changes in the xpaths needed to locate them.

To resolve the test case failure, the test script needs to be updated with the correct xpaths for the elements in the new version of the application. Specifically, the xpath for the "Name" element should be updated to "//*[@id="NewUserName"]" to match the new version. Additionally, ensure that the xpaths for the other elements ("Password:" and "Log in") are also updated accordingly to prevent any further test failures.
