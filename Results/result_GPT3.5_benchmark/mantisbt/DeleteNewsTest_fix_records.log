Explanation:
In the new version of the HTML provided, there is no `class` attribute present in any of the `<div>` elements. Therefore, it is not possible to reproduce the exact operation of targeting a `<div>` element with a specific class attribute value using the XPath expression "//div[@class=''". Since the class attribute is not available in the new HTML, the XPath expression cannot be directly translated to target a specific `<div>` element based on its class attribute.

To achieve a similar operation in the new version, you would need to identify a different attribute or property that uniquely identifies the `<div>` element you want to target. Without the class attribute, you may need to consider other attributes like `align`, `id`, `name`, or the structure of the HTML to create a new XPath expression that can effectively locate the desired `<div>` element.

In this case, without a class attribute in the new HTML, the exact operation of targeting a `<div>` element with a specific class attribute value cannot be reproduced.
