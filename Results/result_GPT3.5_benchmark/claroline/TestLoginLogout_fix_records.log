Test Intent: The test case TestLoginLogout.java is testing the functionality of logging into a web application using predefined admin user credentials and then logging out successfully. The test case sets up the Chrome driver, navigates to the base URL, enters the admin username and password, clicks on the submit button to login, clicks on the logout link, and finally verifies that the user is redirected to the authentication page by checking the presence of the "Authentication" text on the page.

7. "Search" xpath="//*[@id="claroBody"]/div[2]/div[2]/form/button" -> Not available in the new version

Root cause and other reasons for test case failure:
1. The root cause of the test case failure is the removal of the "Search" button element in the new version. The error message indicates that the test case is unable to locate the element "button[type="submit"]", which corresponds to the missing "Search" button.
2. Other reasons for the test case failure could be the changes in the xpaths of the "Enter" button and "Lost password" link. The xpath for the "Enter" button has been updated in the new version, which could also lead to element not found error. Similarly, the xpath for the "Lost password" link has been modified, and if the test case is interacting with this element, it may fail due to the xpath change.
3. The addition of a new element "CS212 - Computer Science" could also impact the test case if it interacts with this element or if the test case is dependent on the presence of specific elements on the page.

In conclusion, the removal of the "Search" button element is the root cause of the test case failure, and other reasons include xpath changes for existing elements and the addition of a new element in the new version of the application.

Test intent: The test case "TestLoginLogout.java" is testing the functionality of logging into a web application (presumably Claroline) and then logging out successfully. The test case sets up the WebDriver with Chrome driver, navigates to the base URL, enters the admin user's credentials, clicks on the login button, clicks on the logout link, and verifies that the user is redirected to the authentication page after logging out.

The test case is verifying the flow of login and logout processes on the web application and ensuring that after logging out, the user is taken back to the authentication page.

The test also includes commented out code that seems to be an alternative way of verifying the presence of the "Authentication" text on the page.

2024-10-28 22:31:53,885:INFO:Cause of failure 1 generated:
Comparing the major elements of the old and new versions, we can see that the "Search from keyword" element is missing in the new version. However, based on the error message provided, the root cause of the test case failure is most likely due to the absence of the "h3" element in the new version, which is not explicitly mentioned in the major elements list.

Root Cause of Test Case Failure:
1. Missing Element in New Version: The "h3" element under the "loginBox" seems to be missing in the new version, which is causing the test case to fail with a "NoSuchElementException" error. The test case is trying to locate an "h3" element within the "loginBox" using the xpath "//*[@id="loginBox"]/h3", but it is not present in the new version.

Other Possible Reasons for Test Case Failure:
1. Changes in XPath: The xpath for the "Enter" button has changed in the new version from "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/button" to "//*[@id="loginBox"]/form/fieldset/input". If the test case is interacting with the "Enter" button, it might be failing due to the xpath change.
2. Changes in Element Names: The "Username" element has been renamed to "User name" in the new version. If the test case is looking for the "Username" element, it will fail to locate it with the updated element name.
3. Structural Changes: The absence of the "Search from keyword" element in the new version may indicate structural changes in the application layout or functionality, which could impact other test cases relying on this element.

Recommendation:
To resolve the test case failure, update the test case to reflect the changes in the new version of the application. Specifically, modify the xpath for locating the "h3" element under the "loginBox" and any other elements that have been changed or removed. Additionally, verify if there are any other affected test cases due to the changes in the application elements and update them accordingly.
